  abstract = "With the help of multi-scale simulation techniques, three examples of the technological application of carbon nanomaterials for storage, conversion and conservation of energy are investigated. First, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as used for electrodes of electrochemical capacitors.
Second, CNTs as used in actuators. And third, diamond and amorphous carbon films as used
in wear resistant coatings.
In order to be able to model CNT electrodes, a simple charge-transfer model is derived
from the CNTs’ electronic structure. This model enables the description of CNTs in the
presence of an electrolyte, even in non-equilibrium situations. A simple continuum PoissonNernst-Planck (PNP) equation is then calibrated from molecular dynamics simulations of
charging. The PNP model describes cyclic voltammograms, and hence the charge-discharge
behavior, of a CNT supercapacitor. It turns out that for a high frequency operation of these
devices, the maximum diffusion length of ions within the electrode material itself is crucial.
While these devices also have technological potential as actuators, the underlying actuation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, charge-induced stresses and strains for
electrochemical actuation of carbon nanotubes are calculated from electronic structure theories. For a given deformation mode the concept of bonding and anti-bonding orbitals can
be defined depending on the sign of a differential band structure stress. The actuation shows
charge asymmetric behavior which is due to next-nearest-neighbor hopping, while Coulombic
contributions account for approximately charge-symmetric isotropic deformations. Defects
and functional groups have negligible influence on the actuation.
In order to understand the behavior of diamond and amorphous carbon under sliding load
a new interatomic potential is developed that allows a proper description of the carbon bond
under such conditions. Diamond is shown to amorphize under high-load, which is exploited
when polishing diamond to remove the material. The surface- and direction-dependency of
this amorphization is explained from the bonding-structure of diamond and stress-fluctuations
within the amorphous-phase. Finally, the establishment of a low-friction coefficient — the
running-in — of amorphous hydrocarbon films is related to a saturation of dangling surfacebonds. This ability to self-passivate crucially depends on the films’ hydrogen content."

  author    = "Hassan, Mohamed Tarek Elewa",
  abstract  = "A detailed understanding of the behaviour of lubricants under high con- finement is crucial for a range of medical and industrial applications. The hydrodynamic framework provides accurate solutions when the contacting bodies are sufficiently separated, however, at extreme operating conditions, the departure from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations is eminent. Atomistic effects can no longer be homogenized and the fluid can not be treated as a continuum-fluid decoupled from the behaviour of its discrete particles. A multiscale treatment of the problem becomes crucial as the fluid operates in the boundary lubrication regime. In this regime, the lubricant is driven by pressure gradients resulting from the gap height variation between the con- tacts. Atomistic models usually rely on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of periodic molecular representative volume elements (RVE), where the lubricant fluid is confined between slab walls. Due to peri- odicity, introducing pressure gradients in such models presents a hurdle. In this thesis, the “pump” method was developed to introduce pressure gradients in perodic RVEs by applying a local perturbation, based on linear momentum conservation, that induces pressure-driven flow of the lubricant. The inde- pendent variable can be the pressure gradient, by fixing the force, or the mass flux, by fixing the current. The two variants are equivalent. The method was tested on compressible and wetting fluids, and applied in conjunction with different thermostating strategies. Thermodynamic field variables of the fluid lubricant including velocity, pressure, flux, and temperature were measured and reported down to confinements of 3 molecular diameters. The pump method can be applied to a channel of arbitrary geometry. This permits the investigation of hydrodynamic cavitation, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous in nature yet not widely investigated on the molecular scale. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to optimize the channel geometry that promotes cavitation. Subsequently, the cavitation lifetime, growth and collapse were compared to the hydrodynamic theoretical predictions. Within a multiscale framework, the pump method can act as the constraint on the molecular system from the larger continuum scale.",

  abstract  = "Sliding, self-mated hydrogel contacts appear in many biological
               and technical applications. It is known that self-mated hydrogel
               contacts have a speed-independent friction regime with small
               friction coefficients at low sliding speeds and a
               speed-dependent friction regime at high sliding speeds. However,
               the exact physical mechanisms driving energy dissipation during
               sliding are unknown. The speed-independent regime has been
               associated with interfacial polymers relaxing faster than they
               are deformed. The speed-dependent regime has been associated
               with both non-equilibrium polymer effects and hydrodynamic
               lubrication. In this work, I present molecular dynamics
               simulations to complement the preceding experimental works. I
               have developed an implicit-solvent based mesoscopic hydrogel
               friction model with either repulsive or adhesive interactions
               across the interface. Both the repulsive and adhesive models
               show velocity-dependent frictional behavior. In combination,
               they show the hydrogel's frictional response across the velocity
               spectrum: interfacial dangling chain conformations are
               independent of sliding velocity at low velocities, reorient
               along the shear direction at intermediate velocities and
               elongate at high velocities. Chain reorientation is associated
               with the friction coefficient increasing linearly with sliding
               velocity and the chain stretching is associated with a friction
               regime with a power-law exponent of approximately 0.5. Following
               my evidence showing that self-mated hydrogel friction is driven
               by interfacial effects at low contact pressures, I abstract the
               hydrogel's interface during sliding to a system of grafted
               chains in shear flow. I show that within the brush, shear stress
               is comprised largely by the polymer's contribution to the stress
               tensor (entropic stress). The entropic shear stress is shown to
               be qualitatively similar in systems of grafted chains and
               hydrogels. Finally, I show how the inclusion of polydispersity
               leads to an entropic shear stress which is qualitatively similar
               to friction curves in self-mated hydrogel friction. In summary,
               this works strengthens the case for polymer relaxation theory in
               highly crosslinked, self-mated hydrogel contacts. i",

  title     = "How surface roughness affects adhesion",
  author    = "Sanner, Antoine",
  abstract  = "At atomic scales, all molecules attract each other, but
               macroscopic objects usually do not stick.The explanation for
               this apparent paradox is that most surfaces are rough, so that
               elastically stiff objects only touch on the top of their
               asperities. Geckos and insects have compliant fibrillar
               structures or soft pads at the tip of their feet that conform to
               surface roughness, sustaining enough adhesion to climb vertical
               walls. Understanding the role of surface roughness in adhesion
               is a challenge because surfaces exhibit roughness down to the
               atomic scale. In this thesis, my collaborators and I investigate
               the effect of surface roughness on adhesion in both stiff and
               compliant contact systems. I model adhesion theoretically, and I
               help experimentalists analyze surface topography over multiple
               scales. The combination of my new models and of the
               comprehensive surface topography characterization by Abhijeet
               Gujrati (University of Pittsburgh), allows us to unravel the
               role of surface roughness in adhesion experiments. Stiff
               materials do not stick because roughness prevents most of the
               surfaces to come into the range of molecular attraction. A
               recent theory quantifies this effect based on an approximate
               expression for the distribution of interfacial gaps near the
               contact edge. Joe Monti (Johns Hopkins University) and I
               benchmark this expression against gap distributions extracted
               from finely resolved numerical simulations. The theory is valid
               provided that adhesive stresses are weak and act over a range
               shorter than a geometrical parameter determined by small-scale
               roughness. Elastically soft (jelly-like) objects stick because
               the elastic penalty to deform into intimate contact is small
               compared to the gain in surface energy. However, theories based
               on this simple thermodynamic argument cannot explain the fact
               that in experiments, the force measured during retraction is
               often much higher than during indentation. This adhesion
               hysteresis can be caused by material specific irreversibility or
               elastic instabilities triggered by surface roughness. The role
               of these instabilities in adhesion hysteresis remains poorly
               understood because existing numerical and theoretical models
               cannot account for realistic roughness in soft contacts. I
               introduce an efficient crack-perturbation model for the contact
               of rough spheres, enabling large scale simulations with
               realistic surface roughness. By clarifying the link between
               adhesion hysteresis and classic pinning problems (for example
               fracture of heterogeneous materials and wetting angle
               hysteresis), this model allows me to derive a simple theoretical
               model linking adhesion hysteresis to surface roughness. In
               combination with the characterization of surface roughness over
               multiple scales, my models shed light on the role of elastic
               instabilities in adhesion experiments. Surfaces are rough from
               the macroscopic scale down to the atomic scale, and the lack of
               comprehensive roughness characterization is the major obstacle
               towards bringing theory and experiments together. Abhijeet
               Gujrati and collaborators measured the roughness of four diamond
               coatings over eight decades of length scales, enabling the
               application of adhesion theories on experiments performed with
               these samples. Besides the experimental challenge of determining
               roughness down to the atomic scale, an additional obstacle to
               the documentation of roughness is the technical complexity of
               established multiscale roughness measures such as the power
               spectral density. My collaborators and I address this problem by
               introducing the scale-dependent roughness parameters (SDRPs), a
               new analysis framework that is easy to interpret and to
               implement. This new analysis, together with several established
               techniques, is available to use through our web-service
               contact.engineering. We thereby encourage the community to
               measure, analyze and publish roughness over multiple length
               scales. The SDRP analysis computes the fluctuations of slopes
               and curvatures as a function of the lateral length scale. Slopes
               and curvatures are important ingredients for rough contact
               theories, but it remains unclear at which scales they matter.
               Luke Thimons (University of Pittsburgh) and I show that in
               macro-scale contacts between ruby spheres and diamond coatings,
               the roughness that critically affects adhesion is between
               lateral length scales of 43~nm to 1.8~µm. The large-scale cutoff
               is related to the finite radius of the spherical indenter, while
               the unimportance of small scales is due to plastic deformations
               and the long range of the adhesive interaction (5~nm). To
               determine the critical range of length scales, as well as the
               parameters of the adhesive interaction, we analyzed the
               experimental pull-off forces by combining surface topography
               characterization and numerical simulations. Adhesion is critical
               in applications such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),
               soft robotics and skin adhesives. Our insights provide guidance
               for practitioners which scales of roughness to control in order
               to tune adhesion, and our framework for surface topography
               characterization will allow a better overall understanding of
               surface topography across the community.",

              relationship between structure and deformation mechanisms",
  author   = "Gola, Adrien",
  abstract = "The mechanical properties of metallic multilayer materials differ from the bulk because of
the properties of interfaces between the layers. These differences become greater as the layer
thickness is reduced to the nanoscale. This thesis describes two FCC metallic multilayer
materials, Cu1−xAgx|Ni and Cu|Au stacked along their [111] axis. These systems form
semi-coherent interfaces with networks of partial Shockley dislocations arranged in a regular
triangular pattern. The two systems represent two alternatives to fine tune the interfaces
properties. The first one, the Cu1−xAgx|Ni system, uses an alloying element, Ag, to fine tune the lattice mismatch between the layers. The second, the Cu|Au system, is a fully miscible
binary system. As such the multilayer stack is a metastable form of the system inevitably
leading to intermixing at the interface.
Molecular dynamics (MD) and a combination of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
methods were used to study the structure and strengthening mechanism of these composite
materials. Calculations were carried out on various geometries and loading conditions, from
representative volume elements to realistic geometries such as nanopillar compression or
nanoscratching setups. With the help of large scale MD calculations it was possible to reach
system sizes directly comparable to experiments.
Ag was found to be a good candidate for alloying in the Cu|Ni binary system as it only forms
a solid solution with Cu and therefore should only alter the Cu layers. As Ag was added
to the Cu layer, it increased the lattice mismatch with the Ni layer, effectively increasing
the density of the network of misfit dislocation at the interface. The excess of Ag in the Cu
layer segregated at preferential sites at the interfaces and pinned the dislocation network.
Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that these modifications increased the strength
of the Cu1−xAgx|Ni systems. This model shows that using a well chosen alloying element
in a binary multilayer system is a route for tuning the strength of a system under various
loading conditions.
A custom EAM potential for the Cu|Au system was developed and compared with preexisting
EAM potentials. This new potential allowed to successfully describe the unary as
well as the stable binary phases existing for this binary system. Investigation of the interface
of the Cu|Au system showed that the interface structure and properties were highly sensitive
to the intermixing between the two species, with a strong increase of the interface shear
strength with intermixing. It was also noticed that this system was sensitive to defects and
heterogeneities in its structure which lead, under tribological load, to the formation of vortex
instabilities at the interfaces. Finally, catastrophic failure was observed of the system under
compression as shear band nucleation was triggered by surface flaws. The observation and
understanding of the effect of defects on the mechanical responses of multilayer systems
can thus lead to a better material design by avoiding or embracing these defects.",

  abstract = "The atomic-scale mechanisms underlying plastic deformation in
              amorphous materials are investigated in this thesis, aiming to
              advance the understanding of the macroscopic behavior of these
              materials. To this end Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are
              carried out on model systems of a Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) and a
              network glass: CuZr and amorphous carbon (a-C). First, the size
              of shear transformation zones (STZs) and evolution of shear bands
              in CuZr BMG are studied. Second, the elastic properties and yield
              behavior of a-C are examined. Single bond breaking events are
              isolated and set into the context of STZs. Shear transformations
              are characterized by correlations of non-affine displacements in
              sheared CuZr BMG. In the elastic regime, the correlation shows
              exponential decay, with a characteristic length that can be
              interpreted as the size a STZ. After yield, shear bands form and
              the correlation length becomes system-size dependent. This can be
              interpreted as a first-order phase transition. The stability of
              such shear bands is studied next. Pauses intermitting the shear
              deformation, allowing the sheared system to cool, do not impact a
              fully developed shear band, even at large applied strain. A
              simulation cell containing two identical shear bands is created
              by duplication of the previous cell. Shearing this super cell
              further does not lead to further localization, rather both shear
              bands coexist. At elevated temperatures, however, the shear bands
              dilate and the deformation becomes more homogeneous. For the
              network glass, a-C, structure and elastic properties are
              determined from representative volumes, for a range of densities
              and amorphous morphologies, quench rates and two interatomic
              potentials with different philosophies: Tersoff+S and Gaussian
              Approximation Potential (GAP). All samples show a universal
              relationship between hybridization, density and bulk modulus,
              despite having distinct cohesive energies. The differences in
              cohesive energy are traced back to slight changes in the
              distribution of bond-angles of these structures. Shearing these
              a-C samples, shear softening and serrated flow is found after an
              initial elastic response and yield. In this flow regime,
              deviatoric stress and hydrostatic pressure follow a
              pressure-modified von Mises (PMvM) law. Using the well defined
              first and second nearest neighbor relations in a-C, the network
              structure in terms of bonds and coordination numbers is analyzed.
              This allows for the application of Thorpe's constraint counting
              theory, which can explain why the network becomes floppy below a
              specific mean coordination number. Finally, individual
              bond-breaking and -forming events, the basic units of STZs, are
              studied in quasi-static shear simulations of the a-C structures.
              The events are extracted from the trajectories by cyclic
              deformations with small amplitudes. The energy landscape of a-C
              is explored around such events. The energy barriers obtained
              follow Eyrings transition state theory. Furthermore, a
              correlation is found between the distance two atoms jump apart
              when the bond breaks and the height of the barrier for this
              event. Using this correlation, the distribution of barrier
              heights for breaking and closing bonds in a-C is computed. The
              energy barrier are set into relation with the globally dissipated
              energy.",

               experimental studies",

  abstract  = "Theoretical studies performed in this thesis aimed to prepare a
               molecular dynamics (MD) simulation model for an antimicrobial
               diamine synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMP)
               homopolymer in a united-atom GROMOS 54A7 force field.
               These studies focused mainly on computing the atomic point
               charges of a model molecule consisting of three repeat units of
               a diamine poly(oxanorbornene) SMAMP using Bader analysis and
               electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting schemes. For this
               purpose, MD simulations were carried out using the GROMACS
               software applying the GROMOS 54A7 force field, and density
               functional theory (DFT) calculations with the
               Perdew--Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional were carried out using
               GPAW. For the validation of this model, a comparison was
               carried out between the potential energy landscapes experienced
               in the classical force field model (GROMOS54A7) using the newly
               computed ESP charges and originally implemented van der Waals
               parameters and the potential energy landscapes in the reference
               ab initio DFT calculations. These landscapes were computed when
               a single water molecule was placed at a varying offset from the
               neutral diamine SMAMP at different adsorption positions. Thus,
               the applied partial charges and the van der Waals parameters of
               diamine SMAMP were validated. The results showed that the
               calculated ESP-fitted charges and Bader charges were in
               qualitative agreement. The ESP-fitted charges of the neutral
               diamine SMAMP were comparable to the partial charges of the
               lysine amino acid, which have already been parameterized and
               implemented in GROMOS 54A7 forced field. Fluctuations
               of the values of the charges obtained by changing the applied
               conformation of diamine SMAMP were also observed. From the
               energy landscape maps, an overall general good agreement was
               achieved between the classical force field and DFT calculations.
               Thus, the ESP-fitted charges and van der Waals parameters of the
               neutral diamine SMAMP presented here can describe its
               interaction with liquid water efficiently. Accordingly, it is
               expected that the ESP-fitted charges and van der Waals
               parameters presented here would also provide a valid description
               of the interaction of diamine SMAMP with biomolecules in aqueous
               solutions. Consequently, this model will enable targeted
               theoretical studies of the antimicrobial mechanism of action of
               SMAMPs with various biomolecules via simulations, specifically
               simulations with the previously reported complex bacterial
               membranes of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus
               aureus (S. aureus) bacteria that have been studied using
               the same force field. Experimental studies performed in this
               thesis aimed to prepare surfaces that contain the antimicrobial
               propyl SMAMP homopolymer (the second SMAMP homopolymer that was
               used in this study after the diamine SMAMP) and/or the
               protein-repellent polysulfobetaines (PSB) and to study their
               potential to prevent protein and bacterial adhesion, the first
               steps in biofilm formation. These polymers were immobilized on
               micro- and nano-patterned structures obtained by the colloidal
               lithography (CL) technique (structure patterns spacings: 200 nm,
               500 nm, 1 µm and 2 µm). The physical properties of the
               fabricated surfaces were investigated using atomic force
               microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. Their protein
               resistivity was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
               spectroscopy. Spray tests were used to study their antimicrobial
               activity against Gram-negative E. coli bacteria. The growth of
               human gingival mucosal keratinocytes on the fabricated surfaces
               was analyzed with the Alamar blue assay, optical microscopy, and
               live-dead staining. Furthermore, for the fabricated bifunctional
               surfaces, additional quantitative nanomechanical measurements
               were performed using atomic force microscopy (QNM-AFM) to obtain
               their local elastic moduli. The results showed the influence of
               the underlying structure itself on the reduction of the protein
               and bacterial adhesion. At the small spacings, the structured
               surfaces had an enhancement in their cell adhesion and
               antimicrobial activity. Additionally, this effect increased when
               the patterned surfaces were functionalized with a cell-adhesive
               polycation polymer, such as propyl SMAMP. The structured
               surfaces functionalized with propyl SMAMP had improved
               antimicrobial activity, a reduction of unspecific protein
               adhesion, and improved cellular adhesion in comparison to the
               unstructured functionalized surfaces with the same polymer.
               Therefore, structured surfaces functionalized with adhesive
               polymers such as SMAMPs could be promising candidates to enhance
               tissue integration on implants. QNM-AFM studies also showed
               that the obtained bifunctional surfaces were quite stiff due to
               the high elastic modules of the underlying substrate. These
               bifunctional surfaces had a reduced antimicrobial activity
               compared to softer bifunctional surfaces fabricated by the
               microcontact printing (µCP) technique. The CL-fabricated
               surfaces also could not fully achieve the required simultaneous
               quantitative antimicrobial activity and protein repellency.
               However, the cell compatibility of the CL-fabricated surfaces
               was maintained at all the tested spacings. The optimum
               spacing of these CL-fabricated surfaces for bioactivity was
               found to be in the range from 500 nm to 1 µm, and a
               significant reduction of antimicrobial activity was observed at
               the larger (2 µm) spacing.",
