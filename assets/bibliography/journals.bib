We further present analytical expressions for second-order derivatives of the potential energy for two-body and generic many-body interatomic potentials, such as cluster and empirical bond-order potentials.

Our simulations of a sliding spherical asperity reveal the following two friction regimes: at low loads, the films show Amonton's friction with a friction force that rises linearly with normal load, and at high loads, the friction force is independent of the load as long as no direct solid-solid contact occurs. The transition between these two regimes happens when a single molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with film density and drops slightly with the transition to hemicylindrical aggregates. This monotonous increase of friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction coefficient reaches a minimum at the intermediate surface concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a competition between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film, and the onset of plowing.},

Here we successfully simulate DW-MRI by using the solution of Bloch equations for each DPD particle while computing its trajectories through DPD forces. To this end, a spin echo sequence combined with different diffusion-weighting gradients was implemented and tested for the diffusion of a fluid bound by different diffusion regimes. Fluid confinement was easily incorporated, which enabled investigating different diffusion regimes and the performance of different pulse sequences. The three different sequences applied were: spin echo single-sided bipolar gradient, spin echo two-sided bipolar gradient and spin echo uni-polar gradient; and the three imaged diffusion regimes of interest were: free diffusion, localization and motional narrowing.},

The latter is based on a splitting into a centre-of-mass contribution represented by DPD, and an internal contribution which is not resolved in the DPD-level of description. As a consequence, simulating the centre-of-mass contribution with DPD requires high Schmidt numbers. After a verification for fundamental pulse sequences, we apply the NMR-DPD method to NMR diffusion measurements of anisotropic fluids, and of fluids restricted by walls of microfluidic channels. For the latter, the free diffusion and the localisation regime are considered.},

The tetrahedra are free to rotate about their centers under the drive of the torque arising from the interparticle potential. The orientations of the water molecules are evolved in time via an overdamped Langevin dynamics for the torque, which is solved by means of a quaternion technique. The resulting advection-diffusion-reaction equation for the quaternion components is solved by a LB method, acting as a dynamic minimizer for the global energy of the fluid. By adding thermal fluctuations to the torque equation, the model is shown to reproduce some microscopic features of real water, such as an average number of hydrogen bonds per molecules (HBs) between 3 and 4, in a qualitative agreement with microscopic water models.

It is shown that, within the Mori-projection operator formalism, the reversible part of the dynamics is equivalent to the finite temperature CGMD-equations of motion, and that dissipative contributions to CGMD can also be included within the Mori formalism. The CGMD nodal momenta in the present graphene model display clear non-Markovian behavior, a property that can be ascribed to the fact that the CGMD-weighting function suppresses high-frequency modes more effectively than, e.g., a simple center of mass (COM) based CG procedure. The present coarse-grained graphene model is also shown to reproduce the short time behavior of the momentum correlation functions more accurately than COM-variables and it is less dissipative than COM-CG. Finally, we find that, while the intermediate time scale represented directly by the CGMD variables shows a clear non-Markovian dynamics, the macroscopic dynamics of normal modes can be approximated by a Markovian dissipation, with friction coefficients scaling like the square of the wave vector. This opens the way to the development of a CGMD model capable of describing the correct long time behavior of such macroscopic normal modes.},

Subsequent evaporation removes the fluid; the micro part remains on its final position, where a second substrate can pick it up. In this way, the wetting control can be separate from the final device substrate. The MDPD method represents a fluid by particles, which are interpreted as a coarse graining of the fluid’s molecules. The choice of interaction forces allows for free surfaces.

However, standard model reduction techniques cannot be applied if the equation system incorporates time-varying matrices or parameters that are to be preserved for the reduced model. However, design cycles often involve parameter modification, which should remain possible also in the reduced model. In this article we demonstrate a novel parameterization method to numerically construct highly accurate parametric ordinary differential equation systems based on a small number of systems with different parameter settings. This method is demonstrated to parameterize the geometry of a model of a micro-gyroscope, where the relative error introduced by the parameterization lies in the region of . We also present recent developments on semi-automatic order reduction methods that can preserve scalar parameters or functions during the reduction process. The first approach is based on a multivariate Padé-type expansion. The second approach is a coupling of the balanced truncation method for model order reduction of (deterministic) linear, time-invariant systems with interpolation. The approach is quite flexible in allowing the use of numerous interpolation techniques like polynomial, Hermite, rational, sinc and spline interpolation. As technical examples we investigate a micro anemometer as well as the gyroscope. Speed-up factors of 20–80 could be achieved, while retaining up to six parameters and keeping typical relative errors below 1%.},

  abstract = {A novel design strategy to avoid pull-in occurrence in electrostatic micro electro mechanical systems is proposed. It combines charge control with ring electrodes, on a circular geometry. This idea is introduced here for the design of efficient and reliable high stroke electrostatic diaphragm micropumps, while it has a broad potential applicability. A minimal lumped one degree-of-freedom model is derived and used to introduce and demonstrate the proposed approach for a circular plate geometry. Finite element models are subsequently adopted for a more detailed device modelling. As expected, charge control exhibits a stabilizing effect with respect to voltage drive, but not sufficient to achieve a full-range stability for the considered geometry. When the electrode area is properly defined, stability range can be extended up to gap closure in the central part of the membrane. In this configuration, the increase in voltage required for full-range device drive would be relevant, while in charge control the penalty is considerably lower. Finally, loading conditions and geometrical parameters for an optimized actuation are suggested.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases, mostly related to atherosclerosis, are the major cause of death in industrial countries. It is observed that blood flow dynamics play an important role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. Especially, the blood velocity distribution is an important indicator for predisposition regions. Today magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delivers, in addition to the morphology of the cardiovascular system, blood flow patterns. However, the spatial resolution of the data is slightly less than 1 mm and owing to severe restrictions in magnetic field gradient switching frequencies and intensities, this limit will be very hard to overcome. In this paper, constrained fluid dynamics is applied within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics formalism to enhance the MRI flow data. On the one hand, constraints based on the known volumetric flow rate are applied. They prove the plausibility of the order of magnitude of the measurements. On the other hand, the higher resolution of the simulation allows one to determine in detail the flow field between the coarse data points and thus to improve their spatial resolution.},

Within the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator approach to CG, there are several possibilities for the definition of the friction matrix, depending on the projector that is being used. In this paper, the connection of two of these projectors (Mori's and Zwanzig's) is discussed and the corresponding merits and limitations are analysed. Moreover, three different ways of computing the friction matrix in the Mori's framework are presented, along with a discussion of their mutual connections. By the example of CG centre of mass blob variables in the graphene lattice, it is shown that, even though the three approaches are equivalent from a theoretical viewpoint, they may differ considerably in terms of practical implementation for computer simulation purposes. In the given example, which is representative for atomic lattices, it turns out that a linear regression of the velocity–velocity correlation function, inspired by the Einstein–Helfand approach, is the least error-prone against disturbances from optical modes.},

The separation of timescales for blobs of 24 and 96 carbon atoms is sufficiently pronounced for the Markovian assumption, inherent to the DPD model, to provide satisfactory results. In particular, the MD velocity autocorrelation function of the blobs is well reproduced by the DPD model, provided that the effect of friction and noise is taken into account. However, DPD cross-correlations between neighbor blobs show appreciable discrepancies with respect to the MD results. Possible extensions to mend these discrepancies are briefly outlined.},

A superposition of different harmonic excitation patterns gives the possibility to control the convective flow. In this investigation, we apply a generic and accurate multi-phase smoothed particle hydrodynamics model to a two-dimensional three-phase flow and consider an oscillating droplet sitting on a substrate and immersed in a fluidic phase. These vibrations are investigated in two ways: the analysis of a step response due to an abrupt change of the contact angle is applied to identify the resonance frequencies. Secondly, the time evolution of the shape of the droplet in terms of harmonic functions is determined. Their amplitudes are examined in the time and frequency domain. This gives the possibility to relate resonance frequencies to mode shapes and to detect a coupling between them. Our approach is successfully applied to different numerical case studies.},

In this report, the resonance frequency of tubes of different lengths and in different states of tension is extracted from the numerical results and shown to fit with continuum elastic theory. Since in many cases, CNTs are produced slacked rather than taut, the effect of slackness on the resonance frequencies is presented and shown to reduce the sensitivity of the resonator considerably. According to our simulations, temperature has a major effect on the resonance frequencies and should be considered when analyzing bridged resonators. The investigation includes measurements of the vibration amplitude at different temperature, tube length, and strain. The intrinsic quality factor of carbon nanotube resonators is also discussed.

Conservation laws are not compromised by the high order polyinomials in the equilibrium distribution arising from the central moment transform. Two sources of instabilities in lattice Boltzmann simulations are discussed: negative numerical viscosity due to insufficient Galilean invariance and aliasing.

However, since the droplet shape is usually heavily distorted, it is difficult to estimate the droplet shape during the process. Further, it is often necessary to know if a process, e.g., droplet splitting on a given geometry, is possible at all, and what can be done to increase the system's reliability. It is thus important to use computer simulations to gain an understanding about the behavior of a droplet for a given electrode geometry and voltage curve. Special care must be exercised when considering surface-tension effects.

The technology brings many advantages. First, it enables a mix of chipmaking technologies for each of the component parts, with each technology selected for its particular technical or financial benefits. Second, it eliminates the need for pick-and-place assembly that would unnecessarily slow down any manual assembly technique. Third, it enables massively parallel assembly, almost independent of the number of parts involved, and thereby mimics the elegant parallelism inherent in microchip circuit manufacture. In this chapter we explore this new technology with the ultimate goal of discovering the practical limits for its practical use in manufacturing real microsystems. The driving force of the assembly process is interface surface tension, and our approach is to find the simplest models that correctly describe the attachment, orientation, and bonding of parts to a suitably prepared substrate. We follow both an analytical and a numerical approach in describing the surface tension effects, the latter mainly to gain geometrical generality, and we couple modeling and simulation with suitable laboratory experiments. The ultimate goal of this work is to find practical design rules with which to select bond site geometries and the properties of participating liquids, and to find practical tolerances for all required geometrical and rheological parameters. This chapter extensively documents all results found to date, and carefully cites other work in this area.}

  abstract = {We present a general formalism for the calculation of correlation functions (CFs) for transport processes through ultra-small structures based on a Wigner function representation. Linear response coefficients are obtained from the CFs at thermal equilibrium. The formalism is applied to a finite conductor in three, two and one dimensions, where we study the transition from diffusive to ballistic regimes for non-degenerate and degenerate conditions. Analytical expressions are given for the limiting cases. Electrical and thermal conductances are expressed in terms of characteristic time- and lengthscales, which are the scattering time and the mean free path in the diffusive regime as well as the transit time and device length in the ballistic regime. For a 1D, degenerate, ballistic system of fermions we find for the electrical conductance the fundamental unit G = 2e<sup>2</sup>/h, for the differential thermoelectric power a = 0 and for the thermal conductance the fundamental unit K = p<sup>2</sup>k<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup>T/(3h), which has been found to hold for the ballistic case of bosons with zero chemical potential as well. We provide the frequency dependence of the kinetic coefficients associated with different timescales belonging to the microscopic system.}

During compression, amorphous silicon undergoes a discontinuous nonequilibrium transition from a low-density to a high-density structure at a pressure of around $13$-$16$~GPa. Ensemble-averaged density and elastic constants change discontinuously across the transition. Densification of individual glassy samples occurs through a series of discrete plastic events, each of which is accompanied by a vanishing shear modulus. This is the signature of a series of elastic instabilities, similar to shear transformation zones observed during shear yielding of glasses. We compare the structure obtained during compression with a near-equilibrium form of amorphous silicon obtained by quenching a melt at constant pressure. This gives structures identical to nonequilibrium compression at low and high pressure, but the transition between them occurs gradually rather than discontinuously. Our observations indicate that the polyamorphic transition is of a nonequilibrium nature, and it has the characteristics of a yield transition that occurs under compression instead of shear.},

Here we combine mesoscopic simulations and experiments to test the polymer-relaxation hypothesis for this velocity dependence, where a velocity-dependent regime emerges when the perturbation of interfacial polymer chains occurs faster than their relaxation at high velocity. Our simulations reproduce the experimental findings, with speed-independent friction at low velocity, followed by a friction coefficient that rises with velocity to some power of order unity. We show that the velocity-dependent regime is characterized by reorientation and stretching of polymer chains in the direction of shear, leading to an entropic stress that can be quantitatively related to the shear response. The detailed exponent of the power law in the velocity dependent regime depends on how chains interact: We observe a power close to $1/2$ for chains that can stretch, while pure reorientation leads to a power of unity. Our simulations quantitatively match experiments and show that the velocity dependence of hydrogel friction at low loads can be firmly traced back to the morphology of near-surface chains.},

The efficiency of the scheme is based on a preconditioned, well-scaled reformulation allowing for the use of the conjugate gradient or similar iterative solvers. The geometrically-optimal preconditioner—a discretized Green’s function of a periodic homogeneous reference problem—has a block-diagonal structure in the Fourier space which permits its efficient inversion using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques for generic regular meshes. This implies that the scheme scales as, like FFT, rendering it equivalent to spectral solvers in terms of computational efficiency. However, in contrast to classical spectral solvers, the proposed scheme works with FE shape functions with local supports and does not exhibit the Fourier ringing phenomenon. We show that the scheme achieves a number of iterations that are almost independent of spatial discretization. The scheme also scales mildly with phase contrast. We also discuss the equivalence between our displacement-based scheme and the recently proposed strain-based homogenization technique with finite-element projection.},

Particular emphasis is laid on the question what constraints ensue from the functional form of a potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for elastic tensor elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of defect and cohesive energies, or why the ratio of boiling to melting temperature tends to be large for potentials describing metals but small for short-ranged pair potentials. The review is meant to be pedagogical rather than encyclopedic. This is why we highlight potentials with functional forms sufficiently simple to remain amenable to analytical treatments. Our main objective is to provide a stimulus for how existing approaches can be advanced or meaningfully combined to extent the scope of simulations based on empirical potentials.},

  abstract = {Species with various reproductive modes accompanied by different mechanical properties of their (lateral) branch-branch junctions have evolved in the cactus subfamily Opuntioideae. Older branches of Opuntia ficus-indica with fracture-resistant junctions often bear flowers and fruits for sexual reproduction, whereas younger branches break off easily and provide offshoots for vegetative propagation. Cylindropuntia bigelovii plants are known for their vegetative reproduction via easily detachable branches that can establish themselves as offshoots. We characterized the elastic and fracture behaviors of these lateral junctions by tensile testing and analyzed local strains during loading. Additionally, we carried out finite element analyses to quantify the influence of five relevant tissue layers on joint elastic behavior. Our fracture analysis revealed various fracture modes: (i) most young samples of Opuntia ficus-indica failed directly at the junction and had smooth fracture surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 4\% of the total strain; (ii) most older samples of Opuntia ficus-indica failed at the adjacent branch and exhibited rough fracture surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 47\%; (iii) most samples of Cylindropuntia bigelovii abscised directly at the junction and exhibited cup and cone surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 28\%. Various geometric and mechanical properties such as junction area, fracture energy, and tensile strength were analyzed with respect to significant differences between species and age of sample. Interestingly, the abscission of lateral branches naturally triggered by wind, passing animals, or vibration showed the following differences in maximum force: 153 N (older Opuntia ficus-indica), 51 N (young Opuntia ficus-indica), and 14 N (Cylindropuntia bigelovii).},

  abstract = {Friction is one of the leading causes of energy loss in moving parts, and understanding how roughness affects friction is of utmost importance. From creating surfaces with high friction to prevent slip and movement, to creating surfaces with low friction to minimize energy loss, roughness plays a key role. By measuring shear stresses of crosslinked elastomers on three rough surfaces of similar surface chemistry across nearly six decades of sliding velocity, we demonstrate the dominant role of adhesive frictional dissipation. Furthermore, while it was previously known that roughness-induced oscillations affected the viscoelastic dissipation, we show that these oscillations also control the molecular detachment process and the resulting adhesive dissipation. This contrasts with typical models of friction, where only the amount of contact area and the strength of interfacial bonding govern the adhesive dissipation. Finally, we show that all the data can be collapsed onto a universal curve when the shear stress is scaled by the square root of elastic modulus and the velocity is scaled by a critical velocity at which the system exhibits macroscopic buckling instabilities. Taken together, these results suggest a design principle broadly applicable to frictional systems ranging from tires to soft robotics.},

  abstract = {The optimization of surface finish to improve performance occurs largely through trial and error, despite significant advancements in the relevant science. There are three central challenges that account for this disconnect: (1) the challenge of integration of many different types of measurement for the same surface to capture the multi-scale nature of roughness; (2) the technical complexity of implementing spectral analysis methods, and of applying mechanical or numerical models to describe surface performance; (3) a lack of consistency between researchers and industries in how surfaces are measured, quantified, and communicated. Here we present a freely-available internet-based application which attempts to overcome all three challenges. First, the application enables the user to upload many different topography measurements taken from a single surface, including using different techniques, and then integrates all of them together to create a digital surface twin. Second, the application calculates many of the commonly used topography metrics, such as root-mean-square parameters, power spectral density (PSD), and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as implementing analytical and numerical calculations, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) for elastic and plastic deformation. Third, the application serves as a repository for users to securely store surfaces, and if they choose, to share these with collaborators or even publish them (with a digital object identifier) for all to access. The primary goal of this application is to enable researchers and manufacturers to quickly and easily apply cutting-edge tools for the characterization and properties-modeling of real-world surfaces. An additional goal is to advance the use of open-science principles in surface engineering by providing a FAIR database where researchers can choose to publish surface measurements for all to use.},

  abstract = {Modelling hydrodynamic lubrication is crucial in the design of engineering components as well as for a fundamental understanding of friction mechanisms. The cornerstone of thin-film flow modelling is the Reynolds equation -- a lower-dimensional representation of the Stokes equation. However, the derivation of the Reynolds equation is based on assumptions and fixed form constitutive relations, that may not generally be valid, especially when studying systems under extreme conditions. Furthermore, these explicit assumptions about the constitutive behaviour of the fluid prohibit applications in a multiscale scenario based on measured or atomistically simulated data. Here, we present a method that considers the full compressible Navier-Stokes equation in a height-averaged sense for arbitrary constitutive relations. We perform numerical tests by using a reformulation of the viscous stress tensor for laminar flow to validate the presented method comparing to results from conventional Reynolds solutions. The versatility of the method is shown by incorporating models for mass-conserving cavitation, wall slip and non-Newtonian fluids. This allows testing of new constitutive relations that not necessarily need to take a fixed form, and may be obtained from experimental or simulation data.},

  abstract = {We study the surface elastic response of pure Ni, the random alloy FeNiCr and an average FeNiCr alloy in terms of the surface lattice Green’s function. We propose a scheme for computing per-site Green’s function and study their per-site variations. The average FeNiCr alloys accurately reproduces the mean Green’s function of the full random alloy. Variation around this mean is largest near the edge of the surface Brillouin-zone and decays as q −2 with wavevector q towards the Γ-point. We also present expressions for the continuum surface Green’s function of anisotropic solids of finite and infinite thickness and show that the atomistic Green’s function approaches continuum near the Γ-point. Our results are a first step towards efficient contact calculations and Peierls–Nabarro type models for dislocations in high-entropy alloys.},

  abstract = {Many naturally formed and processed surfaces are rough over a broad range of length scales. Surface roughness reduces the area of contact between solids, with ramifications for phenomena that depend on the geometry of the interface and the amount of direct contact, including friction and adhesion. In this work, we employ large-scale boundary-element simulations for nonadhesive, elastic solids to study the size dependence of contact patch mean pressure and geometry for patches formed between solids with self-affine fractal surface roughness across seven decades in patch area. Contact patches with diameters smaller than a crossover length scale of order the minimum wavelength of roughness are generally compact with simple geometries and bear pressures well described by Hertz theory. The patch pressure in contact patches larger than the crossover scale rises logarithmically before saturating at a finite value. Furthermore, the largest contact patches formed during our simulations are ramified and populated with regions out of contact, or bubbles, which reduce patch area and increase patch perimeter. As a result, we show that the mean contact diameter of the largest patches saturates, indicating that the patch contact area is proportional to the total patch perimeter. We quantify the effects of bubbles on patch area and perimeters as a function of Hurst exponent and contrast our findings with results of comparable bearing-area model calculations. The slow evolution of the mean patch pressure with patch size in our large-scale calculations explains the common observation that the global mean contact pressure depends on the structure of the roughness, the contact area, and even on system size.},

However, the role of these instabilities in adhesion hysteresis remains poorly understood because we lack theoretical and numerical models accounting for realistic roughness. Our work focuses on the adhesion of soft elastic spheres with low roughness or weak heterogeneity, where the indentation process can be described as a Griffith-like propagation of a nearly circular external crack. We discuss how to describe the contact of spheres with chemical heterogeneity that leads to fluctuations in the local work of adhesion. We introduce a variational first-order crack-perturbation model and validate our approach using boundary-element simulations. The crack-perturbation model faithfully predicts contact shapes and hysteretic force-penetration curves, provided that the contact perimeter remains close to a circle and the contact area is simply connected. Computationally, the crack-perturbation model is orders of magnitude more efficient than the corresponding boundary element formulation, allowing for realistic heterogeneity fields.},

We demonstrate the relationship between SDRP and other common statistical methods for analyzing surfaces: the height-difference autocorrelation function (ACF), variable bandwidth methods (VBMs) and the power spectral density (PSD). We use computer-generated and measured topographies to demonstrate the benefits of SDRP analysis, including: novel metrics for characterizing surfaces across scales, and the detection of measurement artifacts. The SDRP is a generalized framework for scale-dependent analysis of surface topography that yields metrics that are intuitively understandable.},

  abstract = {In many microsystem applications, a nanometric surface quality is crucial to the performance of a device. Soft abrasive flow machining (SAFM) is capable of finishing surfaces at very fine scale with complex geometries since, unlike traditional flow machining processes, abrasive grains are carried by a very low viscosity fluid. Several empirical studies have been done to ensure final high quality surfaces by enhancing the performance of SAFM. However, the present study aims to propose a consistent numerical approach which can handle the fluid-structure interface problems as well as surface erosion to model SAFM and help to gain deeper understanding of the process. Moreover, the approach is employed to investigate the effect of an external magnetic field on the performance of the machining process. All phases, namely carrier fluid, abrasive grains and workpiece, and their interactions are fully resolved by using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The abrasive grains are modeled by particles that are rigidly moved together. The approach is used to study the surface finishing of a Polymethyl Methacrylate-based microchannel under external magnetic fields. Results show that a magnetic field of suitable strength can considerably improve the material removal rate and hence enhance the performance of SAFM.},

The distribution exhibits a power-law divergence for small gaps, and we use numerical simulations with fine resolution to confirm the scaling. The characteristic length scale over which the power-law regime persists is given by the product of the rms surface slope and the mean diameter of contacting regions. We show that these results remain valid for weakly adhesive contacts and connect these observations to recent theories for adhesion between rough surfaces.},

Fully atomistic simulations must consider large blocks of atoms to support long-wavelength deformation modes, meaning that most atoms are far removed from the region of interest. Building on earlier methods that used elastic surface Green's functions to compute static substrate deformation, we present a numerically efficient dynamic Green's function technique to treat realistic, time-evolving, elastic solids. Our method solves substrate dynamics in reciprocal space and utilizes precomputed Green's functions that exactly reproduce elastic interactions without retaining the atomic degrees of freedom in the bulk. We invoke physical insights to determine the necessary number of explicit substrate layers required to capture the attenuation of subsurface waves as a function of surface wave vector. We observe that truncating substrate dynamics at depths that fall as a power of wave vector allows us to accurately model wave propagation without implementing arbitrary damping. The framework we have developed substantially accelerates molecular dynamics simulations of large elastic substrates. We apply the method to single asperity contact, impact, and sliding friction problems and present our preliminary findings.},

  abstract = {The surface topography of diamond coatings strongly affects surface properties such as adhesion, friction, wear, and biocompatibility. However, the understanding of multi-scale topography, and its effect on properties, has been hindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture only a single length scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are characterized using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness down to the sub-nanometer scale. Then these measurements are combined, using the power spectral density (PSD), with conventional methods (stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of topography. The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring topography across all length scales, especially because their PSDs cross over one another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger scale may be smoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements reveal the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with characteristic scaling behavior at and slightly below the mean grain size, and self-affine fractal-like roughness at other length scales. At small (subgrain) scales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness that is self-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This approach of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed comprehensive topography characterization, and all of the topography data from these surfaces has been made available for further analysis by experimentalists and theoreticians. Scientifically, this investigation has identified four characteristic regions of topography scaling in polycrystalline diamond materials.},

Here, we use atomic-scale simulations to make quantitative and mechanistic predictions of fracture of a-C. Systematic large-scale K-field controlled atomic-scale simulations of crack propagation are performed for a-C samples with densities of ρ=2.5, 3.0, and 3.5g/cm3 created by liquid quenches for a range of quench rates ˙Tq=10–1000K/ps. The simulations show that the crack propagates by nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids. Distances of ≈1nm between nucleated voids result in a brittlelike fracture toughness. We use a crack growth criterion proposed by Drugan, Rice, and Sham [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 30, 447 (1982)] to estimate steady-state fracture toughness based on our short crack-length fracture simulations. Fracture toughness values of 2.4–6.0MPa√m for initiation and 3–10MPa√m for the steady-state crack growth are within the experimentally reported range. These findings demonstrate that atomic-scale simulations can provide quantitatively predictive results even for fracture of materials with a ductile crack propagation mechanism.},

Among the existing numerical tools for topology optimization in engineering problems, the adjoint method represents a promising and versatile technique, which can also be applied to the field of full film tribology. In particular, the design of surfaces with complex textures can thoroughly benefit from this method, as it allows dealing with a large number of degrees of freedom at low computational cost. We show that this optimization method can be successfully applied to cavitating lubricant flows such as in pin-on-disc tribometers, giving the possibility to extend the results also to other typical applications such as journal and slider bearings. It is shown that the adjoint method can optimize the whole gap height distribution point by point in a more efficient way than traditional optimization approaches and parametric studies. In particular, thanks to the sensitivity analysis the adjoint method is able to find the placement and depth profile of each texture element.},

  abstract = {Most natural and man-made surfaces appear to be rough on many length scales. There is presently no unifying theory of the origin of roughness or the self-affine nature of surface topography. One likely contributor to the formation of roughness is deformation, which underlies many processes that shape surfaces such as machining, fracture, and wear. Using molecular dynamics, we simulate the biaxial compression of single-crystal Au, the high-entropy alloy Ni36.67Co30Fe16.67Ti16.67, and amorphous Cu50Zr50 and show that even surfaces of homogeneous materials develop a self-affine structure. By characterizing subsurface deformation, we connect the self-affinity of the surface to the spatial correlation of deformation events occurring within the bulk and present scaling relations for the evolution of roughness with strain. These results open routes toward interpreting and engineering roughness profiles.},

  abstract = {We used nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the shear deformation of metallic composites composed of alternating layers of Cu and Au. Our simulations reveal the formation of “vortices” or “swirls” if the bimaterial interfaces are atomically rough and if none of the \{111\} planes that accommodate slip in fcc materials are exactly parallel to this interface. We trace the formation of these patterns back to grain rotation, induced by hindering dislocations from crossing the bimaterial interface. The instability is accompanied by shear softening of the material. These calculations shed light on recent observations of pattern formation in plastic flow, mechanical mixing of materials, and the common formation of a tribomutation layer in tribologically loaded systems.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of adhesion in soft materials is critical in the fields of transportation (tires, gaskets, and seals), biomaterials, microcontact printing, and soft robotics. Measurements have long demonstrated that the apparent work of adhesion coming into contact is consistently lower than the intrinsic work of adhesion for the materials, and that there is adhesion hysteresis during separation, commonly explained by viscoelastic dissipation. Still lacking is a quantitative experimentally validated link between adhesion and measured topography. Here, we used in situ measurements of contact size to investigate the adhesion behavior of soft elastic polydimethylsiloxane hemispheres (modulus ranging from 0.7 to 10 MPa) on 4 different polycrystalline diamond substrates with topography characterized across 8 orders of magnitude, including down to the angstrom scale. The results show that the reduction in apparent work of adhesion is equal to the energy required to achieve conformal contact. Further, the energy loss during contact and removal is equal to the product of the intrinsic work of adhesion and the true contact area. These findings provide a simple mechanism to quantitatively link the widely observed adhesion hysteresis to roughness rather than viscoelastic dissipation.},

The stress–strain behaviors obtained from both techniques are in excellent agreement. Variation in the layer thickness reveals an increase in the strength with a decreasing layer thickness. Pillars fail through the formation of shear bands whose nucleation they trace back to the existence of surface flaws. This combined approach demonstrates the crucial role of contact geometry in controlling the deformation mode and suggests that modulus-matched nanolaminates should be able to suppress strain localization while maintaining controllable strength.},

@article{li_glass_2019,
  abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the formation of glasses during severe plastic deformation of crystalline Cu{\textbar}Zr nano-layers in a simple shear geometry. The early stage of plasticity is governed by dislocation plasticity. Dislocation-interface interaction induces interface roughening and slow atomic-level intermixing around interfaces. A solid-state crystal-to-amorphous transition starts near the interfaces. At high strain, the interfaces are refined to merge, leading to the formation of an intermixed glassy zone that eventually spans our simulation cell. Dislocation emission is then suppressed and strain is fully accommodated by this glassy phase. We characterize the crystal-to-amorphous transition using local structural measures, such as the pair distribution function and Voronoi analysis. The onset of glass formation occurs at a critical shear strain that increases with layer thickness. Our simulations indicate that the parameter controlling this onset is the theoretical affine interface distance, i.e. the amorphization occurs at a critical value of around 3--4 nm that increases slightly with the increase of layer thickness. Our work provides insights on mechanically driven glass formation in multicomponent systems, as e.g. realized in ball-mills or high-pressure torsion experiments.},

Elemental segregation of Ni and Ti is observed in the consolidated nanostructured material. Amorphous, nearly pure Nickel (96\%) nanophases form within the amorphous Ni50Ti50 alloy. Combining atom probe tomography and scanning transmission electron microscopy with computer modelling, we explore the formation process of such amorphous nanophase structure. It is shown that the Ni rich amorphous phase in the consolidated nanostructured material is responsible for the ferromagnetic behavior of the sample whereas the rapidly quenched amorphous and crystalline samples with the same chemical composition (Ni50Ti50) were found to be paramagnetic. Due to the high cooling rate obtained using the inert gas condensation technique, an exceptional control over the crystallization processes is possible, promoting the formation of various amorphous phases, which are not obtained by standard rapid quenching techniques. Our findings demonstrate the potential of amorphous metallic nanostructures as advanced technological materials, and useful magnetic compounds.},

@article{khanal_characterization_2018,
  abstract = {Multi-scale surface topography is critical to surface function, yet the very smallest scales of topography are not accessible with conventional measurement techniques. Here we demonstrate two separate approaches for measuring small-scale topography in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The first technique harnesses `conventional' methods for preparation of a TEM cross-section, and presents how these methods may be modified to ensure the preservation of the original surface. The second technique involves the deposition of the material of interest on a pre-fabricated substrate. Both techniques enable the observation and quantification of surface topography with {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale resolution. Then, using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to quantify the sample thickness, we demonstrate that there is no systematic effect of thickness on the statistical measurements of roughness. This result was verified using mathematical simulations of artificial surfaces with varying thickness. The proposed explanation is that increasing the side-view thickness of a randomly rough surface may change which specific features are sampled, but does not significantly alter the character (e.g. root-mean-square (RMS) values and power spectral density (PSD)) of the measured topography. Taken together, this work establishes a new approach to topography characterization, which fills in a critical gap in conventional approaches: i.e. the measurement of smallest-scale topography.},

Despite extensive research, however, the complex atomic-scale structures and chemical reactivity of ta-C surfaces are incompletely understood. Here, we combine machine learning, density functional tight binding, and density functional theory simulations to shed new light on this long-standing problem. We make atomistic models of ta-C surfaces, characterize them by local structural fingerprints, and provide a library of structures at different system sizes. We then move beyond the pure element and exemplify how chemical reactivity (hydrogenation and oxidation) can be modeled at the surfaces. Our work opens up new perspectives for modeling the surfaces and interfaces of amorphous solids, which will advance studies of ta-C and other functional materials.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes the submissions to a recently announced contact-mechanics modeling challenge. The task was to solve a typical, albeit mathematically fully defined problem on the adhesion between nominally flat surfaces. The surface topography of the rough, rigid substrate, the elastic properties of the indenter, as well as the short-range adhesion between indenter and substrate, were specified so that diverse quantities of interest, e.g., the distribution of interfacial stresses at a given load or the mean gap as a function of load, could be computed and compared to a reference solution. Many different solution strategies were pursued, ranging from traditional asperity-based models via Persson theory and brute-force computational approaches, to real-laboratory experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a model, in which the original assignment was scaled down to the atomistic scale. While each submission contained satisfying answers for at least a subset of the posed questions, efficiency, versatility, and accuracy differed between methods, the more precise methods being, in general, computationally more complex. The aim of this paper is to provide both theorists and experimentalists with benchmarks to decide which method is the most appropriate for a particular application and to gauge the errors associated with each one.},

Here, we present a plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition process for a-C:H that exhibits growth rates of 100 nm min<sup>–1</sup> and higher. The tribological performance of the resulting a-C:H films has been studied experimentally by reciprocating sliding of an a-C:H-coated Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball on an a-C:H-coated 100Cr6 steel substrate and by subsequent micro Raman spectroscopy of the wear track. Running-in of the coatings is observed and characterised by a rapid decrease in the friction coefficient accompanied by a significant increase in sp<sup>2</sup> hybridisation in the wear track. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying running-in mechanisms, the sliding of two a-C:H films under a load of 5 GPa has been studied by classical molecular dynamics employing a range-corrected Brenner bond-order potential. The simulations reproduce the experimental trends and explain the running-in by a combination of smoothing and chemical passivation of both tribosurfaces. Consequently, both mechanisms should be controlled in order to produce tribological coatings for applications with optimum energy-efficiency.},

As structures shrink to the nanoscale, surface damage produced by focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation destroying the region of interest and degrading the resolution of TEM images becomes increasingly a problem. The thickness of the damaged layer at the sidewalls of a prepared cross section is around 20–30 nm for silicon at typical beam energies of 30 keV. In order to reduce these artifacts to a minimum low beam energies have been proposed for FIB polishing. We use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to assess the influence of the focused ion beam on the surface structure of silicon for beam energies ranging from 1–5 keV and a grazing angle of 10° typically used in low voltage FIB polishing. Under these conditions, the thickness of the amorphous layer depends linearly on the beam energy. Intrinsic surface stresses introduced by FIB are always tensile and of a magnitude of around 1 GPa.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of W/WC sliding couples exhibit the formation of a nanoscale amorphous W/WC interface. The infrequent occurrence of atomic jamming events in the interface resulted in the emission of dislocations into the W bulk and the generation of amorphous shear bands in the WC counter body in agreement with the different third bodies observed in W and WC after the experiments.},

  abstract = {Modeling interfacial phenomena often requires both a detailed atomistic description of surface interactions and accurate calculations of long-range deformations in the substrate. The latter can be efficiently obtained using an elastic Green's function if substrate deformations are small. We present a general formulation for rapidly computing the Green's function for a planar surface given the interatomic interactions, and then coupling the Green's function to explicit atoms. The approach is fast, avoids ghost forces, and is not limited to nearest-neighbor interactions. The full system comprising explicit interfacial atoms and an elastic substrate is described by a single Hamiltonian and interactions in the substrate are treated exactly up to harmonic order. This concurrent multiscale coupling provides simple, seamless elastic boundary conditions for atomistic simulations where near-surface deformations occur, such as nanoindentation, contact, friction, or fracture. Applications to surface relaxation and contact are used to test and illustrate the approach.},

  abstract = {Diamond surfaces wear when sliding against silica – a much softer material. Although this plays a major role in chemical mechanical planarization of diamond or machining of rocks, the underlying microscopic mechanisms are hardly understood. Here, the stability of diamond (110) surfaces in sliding contact with amorphous silica and with amorphous silicon (a mechanically similar reference system) is studied by quantum-chemical simulations. Interfacial C–Si bonds with amorphous silicon are too weak to harm diamond (110) surfaces. Conversely, strong C–O and C–Si bonds form between silica and diamond. However, this alone is insufficient to challenge interfacial diamond-like C–C bonds during sliding. Analysis of local forces and electronic structure shows that bonding to silica can chemically activate C–C bonds between terminating carbon zigzag chains and bulk diamond when the zigzag chains stay aromatic. Mechanochemical breaking of these weak bonds and subsequent lifting of C–C–C zigzag units mark the onset of wear on diamond (110) surfaces. This is in contrast to the silicon case, where the higher interfacial bond density renders the diamond surface non-aromatic and diamond-like.},

Distortion-induced symmetry breaking makes conventional, translation-periodic simulations invalid, which has triggered developments for new methods. Revised periodic boundary conditions (RPBC) is a simple method that enables simulations of complex material distortions, either classically or quantum mechanically. The mathematical details of this easy-to-implement approach, however, have not been discussed before. Therefore, in this paper, we summarize the underlying theory, present the practical details of RPBC, especially related to a nonorthogonal tight-binding formulation, discuss selected features, electrostatics in particular, and suggest some examples of usage. We hope this article can give more insight into RPBC, and it will help and inspire new software implementations capable of exploring the physics and chemistry of distorted nanomaterials.},

In classical electrostatics, a metallic surface is properly described if the electric field perpendicular to the surface vanishes. For nanoscale materials, however, charge screening is imperfect because the nanoscale object’s surface density of states is finite. Here, we demonstrate that from quantum considerations a classical mean-field charge-transfer model can be extracted, which is demonstrated for graphene and metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes. The model is easily parametrized and gives an approximate description of the binding of point charges on these structures. Potential applications include the modeling of charged or fully biased nanoscale systems in a polar environment, which we demonstrate by simulating a water droplet in a biased graphene nanocapacitor at a fraction of the computational cost of a fully quantum-mechanical treatment.},

Each bead is first identified by incorporated color tags which are either dyes or luminescing quantum dots (QDs). Subsequently, the reaction-specific fluorescence signal is quantified. The read-out process is accelerated by an in-house-developed image-processing algorithm. The optical read-out device consists of standard components, e.g. a color CCD-camera as detection unit, an LED as light source, optical filters, and a drive to spin the polymer disk. The liquid handling along the complete assay protocol is realized on a centrifugal lab-on-a-disk platform.

  abstract = {While carbon nanotubes have technological potential as actuators, the underlying actuation mechanisms remain poorly understood. We calculate charge-induced stresses and strains for electrochemical actuation of carbon nanotubes with different chiralities and defects, using density-functional theory and various tight-binding models. For a given deformation mode the concept of bonding and antibonding orbitals can be redefined depending on the sign of a differential band-structure stress. We use this theoretical framework to analyze orbital contributions to the actuation. These show charge asymmetric behavior which is due to next-nearest-neighbor hopping while Coulombic contributions account for approximately charge-symmetric isotropic deformations. In the typical case of a (10,10) tube strains around 0.1% with 1 nN force along the tube axis are obtained. Defects and functional groups have negligible influence on the actuation. In multiwall tubes we find charge inversion on the inner tubes due to Friedel-type oscillations which could lead to a slight magnification of charge-induced strains. Finally, we consider photoactuation of nanotubes and predict that transitions between van-Hove singularities can be expected to expand the tubes.},

Nevertheless, polishing diamond is possible with a process that has remained unaltered for centuries and is still used for jewellery and coatings: the diamond is pressed against a rotating disc with embedded diamond grit2. When polishing polycrystalline diamond, surface topographies become non-uniform because wear rates depend on crystal orientations3. This anisotropy is not fully understood4 and impedes diamond’s widespread use in applications that require planar polycrystalline films, ranging from cutting tools5 to confinement fusion6. Here, we use molecular dynamics to show that polished diamond undergoes an sp3–sp2 order–disorder transition resulting in an amorphous adlayer with a growth rate that strongly depends on surface orientation and sliding direction, in excellent correlation with experimental wear rates7. This anisotropy originates in mechanically steered dissociation of individual crystal bonds8. Similarly to other planarization processes9, the diamond surface is chemically activated by mechanical means. Final removal of the amorphous interlayer proceeds either mechanically or through etching by ambient oxygen.},

  abstract = {The lubrication mechanisms in ultrathin solid gold films confined between two rough nickel surfaces have been investigated employing classical molecular dynamics with a second moment tight-binding potential. Three types of nickel surfaces are considered: Ni(111), Ni(001) single- and an Ni(001) - (111) bicrystal. In all three systems, gold layers that have been quenched from the melt organise in (111) layers parallel to the nickel interfaces. The relative sliding of the two single crystal nickel tribopartners requires a shear stress of around 170 MPa - a value that is almost one order of magnitude lower than the ideal plastic shear stress of single crystal bulk gold. This reduced stress can be explained by a misfit dislocation mechanism in a single plane close to the Ni/Au interface. In the case of the Ni(001) - (111) bicrystal, the nickel grain boundaries induce grain boundaries in the quenched gold film which vanish during sliding. During subsequent sliding the nickel grain boundaries act as nucleation centres for dislocation loops leading to an increased shear stress of 490 MPa. The same is observed for an embedded hydrocarbon impurity. Also here dislocation loops are emitted on (111) planes that are tilted with respect to the sliding plane.},

Tribochemical amorphization of the contact zone between the colliding diamond grains followed by fracture events at the asperity shoulders produces ultra-nanodiamonds that remain attached to the amorphous carbon phase.

Specific systems investigated include two and three nested nanotube shells, the insertion of a capped nanotube into another, a connected (12,0)/(6,6) nanotube junction, and the properties of a nanotube acting as a probe over a flat aluminum surface. First-principles estimates of the capacitance matrix coefficients for all these systems are provided, along with a discussion of the quantum corrections.

  abstract = {Linear sp-hybridized carbon chains have recently been proposed as one-dimensional nanostructures for electronic applications and as intermediate products in many nanoscale processes. However, their synthesis and observation are affected by their degradation upon oxygen exposure. Carbon chains consisting of alternating single and triple bonds (polyynic) are reported to be more stable than those consisting of double bonds (cumulenic), but the details of the degradation mechanism are still unknown. We use density functional theory to show that adsorption of O2 on carbon chains anchored to carbon substrates can cause their cleavage through the collective scission of O–O and C–C bonds, yielding separate CO-terminated chains. Further O2 attack progressively shortens them, causing CO2 formation. While the shortening process has general validity, the cleavage step of the reaction is exothermic for cumulenic chains only. Perturbations of the ideal structure, such as bending of the chains or modifications to the structure of their termination, affect the oxidation mechanism and can make the cleavage reaction exothermic for polyynic chains as well. These results contribute to the interpretation of the available experimental results and reveal atomic-scale details of the oxidation process, thus allowing predictions on the chemistry of nanostructured carbon surfaces and suggesting possible new directions for the study of the chemical stability of carbynoid structures.},

  abstract = {Coulson’s bond order is a chemically intuitive quantity that measures the difference in the occupation of bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. Both empirical and rigorously derived bond order expressions have evolved in the course of time and proven very useful for atomistic modeling of materials. The latest generation of empirical formulations has recently been augmented by screening-function approaches. Using friction and wear of diamond and diamond-like carbon as examples, we demonstrate that such a screened bond order scheme allows for a faithful description of dynamical bond-breaking processes in materials far from equilibrium. The rigorous bond order expansions are obtained by systematic coarse-graining of the tight binding approximation and form a bridge between the electronic structure and the atomistic modeling hierarchies. They have enabled bottom-up derivations of bond order potentials for covalently bonded semiconductors, transition metals, and multicomponent intermetallics. The recently developed magnetic bond order potential gives a correct description of both directional covalent bonds and magnetic interactions in iron and is able to correctly predict the stability of bulk Fe polymorphs as well as the intricate properties of dislocation cores. The bond order schemes hence represent a family of reliable and powerful models that can be applied in large-scale simulations of complex processes involving fracture, wear, and plasticity.}

Two types of DLC films are grown by CH2 deposition on an amorphous substrate with 45 and 60 eV impact energy resulting in 45 and 30% H content as well as 50 and 30% sp3 hybridization of the final films, respectively. By combining two equivalent realizations for both impact energies, a hydrogen-depleted and a hydrogen-rich tribo-contact is formed and studied for a realistic sliding speed of 20 m s−1 and loads of 1 and 5 GPa. While the hydrogen-rich system shows a pronounced drop of the friction coefficient for both loads, the hydrogen-depleted system exhibits such kind of running-in for 1 GPa, only. Chemical passivation of the DLC/DLC interface explains this running-in behavior. Fluctuations in the friction coefficient occurring at the higher load can be traced back to a cold welding of the DLC/DLC tribo-surfaces, leading to the formation of a transfer film (transferred from one DLC partner to the other) and the establishment of a new tribo-interface with a low friction coefficient. The presence of a hexadecane lubricant leads to low friction coefficients without any running-in for low loads. At 10 GPa load, the lubricant starts to degenerate resulting in enhanced friction.},

@article{pastewka_contact_2014,
  abstract = {At the molecular scale, there are strong attractive interactions between surfaces, yet few macroscopic surfaces are sticky. Extensive simulations of contact by adhesive surfaces with roughness on nanometer to micrometer scales are used to determine how roughness reduces the area where atoms contact and thus weakens adhesion. The material properties, adhesive strength, and roughness parameters are varied by orders of magnitude. In all cases, the area of atomic contact is initially proportional to the load. The prefactor rises linearly with adhesive strength for weak attractions. Above a threshold adhesive strength, the prefactor changes sign, the surfaces become sticky, and a finite force is required to separate them. A parameter-free analytic theory is presented that describes changes in these numerical results over up to five orders of magnitude in load. It relates the threshold adhesive strength to roughness and material properties, explaining why most macroscopic surfaces do not stick. The numerical results are qualitatively and quantitatively inconsistent with classical theories based on the Greenwood-Williamson approach that neglect the range of adhesion and do not include asperity interactions.},

  abstract = {The total elastic stiffness of two contacting bodies with a microscopically rough interface has an interfacial contribution <em>K</em> that is entirely attributable to surface roughness. A quantitative understanding of <em>K</em> is important because it can dominate the total mechanical response and because it is proportional to the interfacial contributions to electrical and thermal conductivity in continuum theory. Numerical simulations of the dependence of <em>K</em> on the applied squeezing pressure <em>p</em> are presented for nominally flat elastic solids with a range of surface roughnesses. Over a wide range of <em>p</em>, <em>K</em> rises linearly with <em>p</em>. Sublinear power-law scaling is observed at small <em>p</em>, but the simulations reveal that this is a finite-size effect. We derive accurate, analytical expressions for the exponents and prefactors of this low-pressure scaling of <em>K</em> by extending the contact mechanics theory of Persson to systems of finite size. In agreement with our simulations, these expressions show that the onset of the low-pressure scaling regime moves to lower pressure as the system size increases.},

We show, by comparison to exact numerical results, that the 1D mapping method fails even qualitatively.

  abstract = {The atomic-scale processes taking place during the sliding of diamond and diamond-like carbon surfaces are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations. During the initial sliding stage, diamond surfaces undergo an amorphization process, while an sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> conversion takes place in tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) surface layers. Upon separation of the sliding samples, the interface fails. A rather smooth failure occurs for a-C:H, where the hydrogen atoms present in the bulk passivate the chemically active carbon dangling bonds. Conversely, sp-hybridized carbon chains are observed to form on diamond and ta-C surfaces. These carbynoid structures are known to undergo a fast degradation process when in contact with oxygen. Using quantum-accurate density functional theory simulations, we present a possible mechanism for the oxygen-induced degradation of the carbon chains, leading to oxidative wear of the sp phase on diamond and ta-C surfaces upon exposure to air. Oxygen molecules chemisorb on C–C bonds of the chains, triggering the cleavage of the chains through concerted O–O and C–C bond-breaking reactions. A similar reaction caused by adsorption of water molecules on the carbon chains is ruled out on energetic grounds. Further O<sub>2</sub> adsorption causes the progressive shortening of the resulting, O-terminated, chain fragments through the same O–O and C–C bond breaking mechanism accompanied by the formation of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules.},

Consistent with the opposite density changes of the two crystals upon melting, the amorphous material is denser than the crystal in silicon and less dense than the crystal in carbon. As a result, its rate of formation is enhanced by pressure in silicon but suppressed in carbon. These results are particularly unexpected for silicon, whose amorphous structure is supposed to be liquidlike only when hydrostatically compressed above the polyamorphic transition pressure (∼14 GPa). Below this pressure, amorphous silicon is expected to have a low-density structure with density close to that of the diamond-cubic crystal. Our simulations show that this polyamorphic transition disappears under shear and high-density, liquidlike amorphous silicon with metallic ductility forms even at low pressure. These results are potentially transferable to other diamond-cubic crystals, like germanium and ice I<sub>h</sub>, and provide insights into nonequilibrium materials transformations that govern friction and wear in tribological systems.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that contact aging due to chemical reactions in single asperity contacts can have a significant effect on friction. However, it is currently unknown how chemically induced contact aging of friction depends on roughness that is typically encountered in macroscopic rough contacts. Here we develop an approach that brings together a kinetic Monte Carlo model of chemical aging with a contact mechanics model of rough surfaces based on the boundary element method to determine the magnitude of chemical aging in silica-silica contacts with random roughness. Our multiscale model predicts that chemical aging for randomly rough contacts has a logarithmic dependence on time. It also shows that friction aging switches from a linear to a nonlinear dependence on the applied load as the load increase. We discover that surface roughness affects the aging behavior primarily by modifying the real contact area and the local contact pressure, whereas the effect of contact morphology is relatively small. Our results demonstrate how understanding of chemical aging can be translated from studies of single asperity contacts to macroscopic rough contacts.},

However, experimental investigations to quantify these links are often inconclusive, because surfaces are fractal-like and the values of measured roughness parameters depend on measurement size. Here we demonstrate the characterization of topography of an ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) surface at the {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as its combination with conventional techniques to achieve a comprehensive surface description spanning eight orders of magnitude in size. We performed more than 100 individual measurements of the nanodiamond film using both TEM and conventional techniques (stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy). While individual measurements of root-mean-square (RMS) height, RMS slope, and RMS curvature vary by orders of magnitude, we combine the various techniques using the power spectral density (PSD) and use this to compute scale-independent parameters. This analysis reveals that "smooth" UNCD surfaces have an RMS slope greater than one, even larger than the slope of the Austrian Alps when measured on the scale of a human step. This approach of comprehensive multi-scale roughness characterization, measured with {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale detail, will enable the systematic evaluation and optimization of other technologically relevant surfaces, as well as systematic testing of the many analytical and numerical models for the behavior of rough surfaces.},

This structure is linked to the inhomogeneous stress field under the moving indenter, where dislocations are trapped when the stress drops below the material's yield stress. Control of the initial tribological loading could therefore be exploited to design surfaces and materials with superior tribological properties.},

However, experimental testing of frictional contact models has proven difficult, because few in situ experiments are able to resolve this real contact area. Here, we present a contact detection method with molecular-level sensitivity. We find that while the friction force is proportional to the real contact area, the real contact area does not increase linearly with normal force. Contact simulations show that this is due to both elastic interactions between asperities on the surface and contact plasticity of the asperities. We reproduce the contact area and fine details of the measured contact geometry by including plastic hardening into the simulations. These new insights will pave the way for a quantitative microscopic understanding of contact mechanics and tribology.},

We find that the multilayers form a semi-coherent interface with a network of partial dislocations arranged in a regular triangular pattern. A combination of MC and MD was used to equilibrate Cu1−xAgx{\textbar}Ni with x = 0\%, 5\% and 10\%. Ag does not enter the Ni-layer but segregates and precipitates from the Cu layers. We find alloying of Cu and Ni at 600 K. All these findings are in good agreement with the experimental binary phase diagrams of the Cu-Ag, Ag-Ni and Cu-Ni systems. The resulting multilayer structures were then sheared parallel and perpendicular to the normal of the bilayer interface. Initial sliding takes place at the Cu{\textbar}Ni interface within the misfit dislocation network, followed by emission of partial dislocations into the Cu layer. Flow stress increases with increasing Ag content. Additional calculations of biaxial tension that suppress sliding at the heterointerface show a similar trend. Strengthening can be attributed to Ag precipitates pinning the Cu{\textbar}Ni heterointerface and to the formation of sessile stacking-fault tetrahedra from the misfit dislocation network whose density increases with the concentration of Ag in the Cu layer.},

  abstract = {Surfaces can be slippery or sticky depending on surface chemistry and roughness. We demonstrate in atomistic simulations that regular and random slip patterns on a surface lead to pressure excursions within a lubricated contact that increase quadratically with decreasing contact separation. This is captured well by a simple hydrodynamic model including wall slip. We predict with this model that pressure changes for larger length scales and realistic frictional conditions can easily reach cavitation thresholds and significantly change the load-bearing capacity of a contact. Cavitation may therefore be the norm, not the exception, under boundary lubrication conditions.}

At the lowest loads, the interfacial mechanics is governed by the contact mechanics of the first asperity that touches. The dependence of contact area on normal force becomes linear at intermediate loads and crosses over to Hertzian at the largest loads. By combining theories for the limiting cases of nominally flat rough surfaces and smooth spheres, we provide parameter-free analytical expressions for contact area over the whole range of loads. Our results establish a range of validity for common approximations that neglect curvature or roughness in modeling objects on scales from atomic force microscope tips to ball bearings.},

  abstract = {Roughness determines many functional properties of surfaces, such as adhesion, friction, and (thermal and electrical) contact conductance. Recent analytical models and simulations enable quantitative prediction of these properties from knowledge of the power spectral density (PSD) of the surface topography. The utility of the PSD is that it contains statistical information that is unbiased by the particular scan size and pixel resolution chosen by the researcher. In this article, we first review the mathematical definition of the PSD, including the one- and two-dimensional cases, and common variations of each. We then discuss strategies for reconstructing an accurate PSD of a surface using topography measurements at different size scales. Finally, we discuss detection and mitigating artifacts at the smallest scales, and how to compute upper/lower bounds on functional properties obtained from models. We accompany our discussion with virtual measurements on computer-generated surfaces. This discussion summarizes how to analyze topography measurements to reconstruct a reliable PSD. Analytical models demonstrate the potential for tuning functional properties by rationally tailoring surface topography - however, this potential can only be achieved through the accurate, quantitative reconstruction of the power spectral density of real-world surfaces.},

The severity of the collision can be controlled by the impact parameter <i>b</i> that measures the width of the projected overlap of the two cylinders. For a cylinder radius of <i>R</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;23&nbsp;nm, three collisions with <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;nm, <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;nm and <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;nm are compared.

In addition, pronounced roughening of the cylinder surfaces, asymmetric material transfer and the generation of wear debris are found in this case. For the <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5 and 1&nbsp;nm collision, the evolution of third-body volume can be quantitatively described by a simple geometric overlap model that assumes a sliding-induced phase transformation localized between both asperities.

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple 'for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

  abstract = {Tetrahedral amorphous carbon coatings have the potential to significantly reduce friction and wear between sliding components. Here, we provide atomistic insights into the evolution of the sliding interface between naked and hydrogen-passivated ta-C sliding partners under dry and lubricated conditions. Using reactive classical atomistic simulations we show that sliding induces a sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> rehybridization and that the shear resistance is reduced by hydrogen-passivation and hexadecane-lubrication---despite our finding that nanoscale hexadecane layers are not always able to separate and protect ta-C counter surfaces during sliding. As asperities deform, carbon atoms within the hexadecane lubricant bind to the ta-C sliding partners resulting in degradation of the hexadecane molecules and in increased material intermixing at the sliding interface. Hydrogen atoms from the passivation layer and from the hexadecane chains continue to be mixed within a sp<sup>2</sup> rich sliding interface eventually generating a tribo-layer that resembles an a-C:H type of material. Upon separation of the sliding partners, the tribo-couple splits within the newly formed sp<sup>2</sup> rich a-C:H mixed layer with significant material transfer across the sliding partners. This leaves behind a-C:H coated ta-C surfaces with dangling C bonds, linear C chains and hydrocarbon fragments.},

  abstract = {Numerous rock engineering applications require a reliable estimation of fracture permeabilities to predict fluid flow and transport processes. Since measurements of fracture properties at great depth are extremely elaborate, representative fracture geometries typically are obtained from outcrops or core drillings. Thus, physically valid numerical approaches are required to compute the actual fracture geometries under in situ stress conditions. Hence, the objective of this study is the validation of a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based numerical approach for a circular granodiorite fracture considering stress-dependent normal closure. The numerical approach employs both purely elastic and elastic–plastic contact deformation models, which are based on high-resolution fracture scans and representative mechanical properties, which were measured in laboratory experiments. The numerical approaches are validated by comparing the simulated results with uniaxial laboratory tests. The normal stresses applied in the axial direction of the cylindrical specimen vary between 0.25 and 10 MPa. The simulations indicate the best performance for the elastic–plastic model, which fits well with experimentally derived normal closure data (root-mean-squared error = 9 µm). The validity of the elastic–plastic model is emphasized by a more realistic reproduction of aperture distributions, local stresses and contact areas along the fracture. Although there are differences in simulated closure for the elastic and elastic–plastic models, only slight differences in the resulting aperture distributions are observed. In contrast to alternative interpenetration models or analytical models such as the Barton–Bandis models and the “exponential repulsion model”, the numerical simulations reproduce heterogeneous local closure as well as low-contact areas ({\textless} 2\%) even at high normal stresses (10 MPa), which coincides with findings of former experimental studies. Additionally, a relative hardness value of 0.14 for granitic rocks, which defines the general resistance to non-elastic deformation of the contacts, is introduced and successfully applied for the elastic–plastic model.},
