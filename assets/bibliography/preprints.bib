  abstract      = "Insects, pick-and-place manufacturing, engineered adhesives,
                   and soft robots employ soft materials to stick to surfaces
                   even in the presence of roughness. Experiments show that the
                   force required for making contact is lower than for
                   releasing it, a phenomenon known as the adhesion hysteresis.
                   The common explanation for this hysteresis is either contact
                   aging or viscoelasticity. Here, we show that adhesion
                   hysteresis emerges even for perfectly elastic contacts and
                   in the absence of contact aging and viscoelasticity because
                   of surface roughness. We present a crack-perturbation model
                   and experimental observations that reveal discrete jumps of
                   the contact perimeter. These stick-slip instabilities are
                   triggered by local differences in fracture energy between
                   roughness peaks and valleys. Pinning of the contact
                   perimeter retards both its advancement when coming into
                   contact and its retraction when pulling away. Our model
                   quantitatively reproduces the hysteresis observed in
                   experiments and allows us to derive analytical predictions
                   for its magnitude, accounting for realistic rough geometries
                   across orders of magnitude in length scale. Our results
                   explain why adhesion hysteresis is ubiquitous and reveal why
                   soft pads in nature and engineering are efficient in
                   adhering even to surfaces with significant roughness.",

                   nanoconfined compressible fluids",

  abstract      = "Although continuum theories have been proven quite robust to
                   describe confined fluid flow at molecular length scales,
                   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal mechanistic
                   insights into the interfacial dissipation processes. Most MD
                   simulations of confined fluids have used setups in which the
                   lateral box size is not much larger than the gap height,
                   thus breaking thin-film assumptions usually employed in
                   continuum simulations. Here, we explicitly probe the long
                   wavelength hydrodynamic correlations in confined simple
                   fluids with MD and compare to gap-averaged continuum
                   theories as typically applied in e.g. lubrication.
                   Relaxation times obtained from equilibrium fluctuations
                   interpolate between the theoretical limits from bulk
                   hydrodynamics and continuum formulations with increasing
                   wavelength. We show how to exploit this characteristic
                   transition to measure viscosity and slip length in confined
                   systems simultaneously from equilibrium MD simulations.
                   Moreover, the gap-averaged theory describes a
                   geometry-induced dispersion relation that leads to
                   overdamped sound relaxation at large wavelengths, which is
                   confirmed by our MD simulations. Our results add to the
                   understanding of transport processes under strong
                   confinement and might be of technological relevance for the
                   design of nanofluidic devices due to the recent progress in
                   fabrication methods.",

                   fracture",

  abstract      = "This work presents a critical overview of the effects of
                   different aspects of model formulation on crack path
                   selection in quasi-static phase field fracture. We consider
                   different evolution methods, mechanics formulations,
                   fracture dissipation energy formulations, and forms of the
                   irreversibility condition. The different model variants are
                   implemented with common numerical methods based on staggered
                   solution of the phase-field and mechanics sub-problems via
                   FFT-based solvers. These methods mix standard approaches
                   with novel elements, such as the use of bound-constrained
                   conjugate gradients for the phase field sub-problem and a
                   heuristic method for near-equilibrium evolution. We examine
                   differences in crack paths between model variants in simple
                   model systems and microstructures with randomly
                   heterogeneous Young's modulus. Our results indicate that
                   near-equilibrium evolution methods are preferable for
                   quasi-static fracture of heterogeneous microstructures
                   compared to minimization and time-dependent methods. In
                   examining mechanics formulations, we find distinct effects
                   of crack driving force and the model for contact implicit in
                   phase field fracture. Our results favor the use of a
                   strain-spectral decomposition for the crack driving force
                   but not the contact model. Irreversibility condition and
                   fracture dissipation energy formulation were also found to
                   affect crack path selection, but systematic effects were
                   difficult to deduce due to the overall sensitivity of crack
                   selection within the heterogeneous microstructures. Our
                   findings support the use of the AT1 model over the AT2 model
                   and irreversibility of the phase field within a crack set
                   rather than the entire domain. Sensitivity to these
                   differences in formulation was reduced but not eliminated by
                   reducing the crack width parameter $\ell$ relative to the
                   size scale of the random microstructures.",
