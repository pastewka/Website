                   shear flow via coarse-grained molecular dynamics
                   simulations. Our simulations confirm that the shear response
                   is dominated by the brush's outermost correlation volume,
                   which depends on shear rate at high Weissenberg number. The
                   system's shear stress can be approximated by the brush's
                   entropic stress. The simulations further reveal that at low
                   Weissenberg number, the entropic shear stress of grafted
                   chains is independent of the Weissenberg number. Increasing
                   the Weissenberg number leads to Wi-dependent behavior:
                   chains first reorient along the shear direction and elongate
                   at higher Wi. The entropic shear stress increases linearly
                   with Weissenberg number in this regime. We relate these
                   calculations to experimental observations on the velocity
                   dependence of brush and hydrogel friction.",

  abstract      = "Although continuum theories have been proven quite robust to
                   describe confined fluid flow at molecular length scales,
                   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal mechanistic
                   insights into the interfacial dissipation processes. Most MD
                   simulations of confined fluids have used setups in which the
                   lateral box size is not much larger than the gap height,
                   thus breaking thin-film assumptions usually employed in
                   continuum simulations. Here, we explicitly probe the long
                   wavelength hydrodynamic correlations in confined simple
                   fluids with MD and compare to gap-averaged continuum
                   theories as typically applied in e.g. lubrication.
                   Relaxation times obtained from equilibrium fluctuations
                   interpolate between the theoretical limits from bulk
                   hydrodynamics and continuum formulations with increasing
                   wavelength. We show how to exploit this characteristic
                   transition to measure viscosity and slip length in confined
                   systems simultaneously from equilibrium MD simulations.
                   Moreover, the gap-averaged theory describes a
                   geometry-induced dispersion relation that leads to
                   overdamped sound relaxation at large wavelengths, which is
                   confirmed by our MD simulations. Our results add to the
                   understanding of transport processes under strong
                   confinement and might be of technological relevance for the
                   design of nanofluidic devices due to the recent progress in
                   fabrication methods.",

                   physisorbed on gold. Our simulations of a sliding spherical
                   asperity reveals two friction regimes: At low loads, the
                   films show Amontons' friction with a friction force that
                   rises linearly with normal load. At high loads, the friction
                   force is independent of load as long as no direct
                   solid-solid contact occurs. The transition between these two
                   regimes happens when only a single molecular layer is
                   confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction
                   force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with
                   film density and drops slightly with the transition to
                   hemicylindrical aggregates. This monotonous increase of
                   friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing
                   model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction
                   coefficient reaches a minimum at intermediate surface
                   concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a competition
                   between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film,
                   and the onset of plowing.",

  abstract      = "This work presents a critical overview of the effects of
                   different aspects of model formulation on crack path
                   selection in quasi-static phase field fracture. We consider
                   different evolution methods, mechanics formulations,
                   fracture dissipation energy formulations, and forms of the
                   irreversibility condition. The different model variants are
                   implemented with common numerical methods based on staggered
                   solution of the phase-field and mechanics sub-problems via
                   FFT-based solvers. These methods mix standard approaches
                   with novel elements, such as the use of bound-constrained
                   conjugate gradients for the phase field sub-problem and a
                   heuristic method for near-equilibrium evolution. We examine
                   differences in crack paths between model variants in simple
                   model systems and microstructures with randomly
                   heterogeneous Young's modulus. Our results indicate that
                   near-equilibrium evolution methods are preferable for
                   quasi-static fracture of heterogeneous microstructures
                   compared to minimization and time-dependent methods. In
                   examining mechanics formulations, we find distinct effects
                   of crack driving force and the model for contact implicit in
                   phase field fracture. Our results favor the use of a
                   strain-spectral decomposition for the crack driving force
                   but not the contact model. Irreversibility condition and
                   fracture dissipation energy formulation were also found to
                   affect crack path selection, but systematic effects were
                   difficult to deduce due to the overall sensitivity of crack
                   selection within the heterogeneous microstructures. Our
                   findings support the use of the AT1 model over the AT2 model
                   and irreversibility of the phase field within a crack set
                   rather than the entire domain. Sensitivity to these
                   differences in formulation was reduced but not eliminated by
                   reducing the crack width parameter $\ell$ relative to the
                   size scale of the random microstructures.",
