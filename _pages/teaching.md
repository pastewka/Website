## Software environment for teaching

We teach numerical techniques and their respective application to problems from science and engineering. In order to participate in our classes, we provide an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntulinux.org/) 16.04 LTS operating system image with all required software preinstalled. The image can be run in the computer labs (using [bwLehrpool](https://www.bwlehrpool.de/)) or on any other computer using a virtualization solution, for example [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). The image can be downloaded [here](https://nc.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/index.php/s/LzydLng2fBJeYYC) (Size: 9 GB, v1.1).
