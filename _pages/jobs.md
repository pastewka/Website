## How to apply

Please contact [Lars Pastewka](mailto:lars.pastewka@imtek.uni-freiburg.de) about these positions (and possibly other openings not posted here). We are a **simulation** group and do not conduct any experiments in the group. We are looking for candidates with the following profile:
* **Modeling:** You feel comfortable working with physical models, i.e. you understand how to describe the physical world around you in terms of differential equations.
* **Coding:** You have experience in writing codes that carry out numerical calculations or analyze data. Ideally, you have used Python, C++ or Rust.
* **Simulation:** You have written simulation codes or codes to evaluate simulation output yourself.

**Please do not apply if your only experience with simulations is running a simulation package, with the exception of molecular dynamics packages (e.g. LAMMPS or GROMACS).**

For applying, please send:
* **Letter of motivation**: Why do you apply for this position? Keep it short.
* **Curriculum vitae**: What is your experience?
* **Academic track record**: Grades from all BSc and MSc programs that you attended
* **References**: List of advisors that would be able to provide recommendation letters (PhD or Postdoc only)

## PhD or Postdoc projects

### Hydrogels

We are looking for **a PhD student or postdoc** to work on the mechanics of hydrogels using coarse-grained molecular dynamics techniques. The project involves developing strategies to build representative hydrogel models as we all developing methods to characterize the mechanical response of these fluctuation, dominated materials. This includes bulk elastic moduli, fracture and friction.

### Molecular simulation of wall slip

**Supervision: <a href="mailto:hannes.holey@kit.edu">Hannes Holey</a>, <a href="mailto:lars.pastewka@imtek.uni-freiburg.de">Lars Pastewka</a>**

When fluids are confined to only a few nanometers, the no-slip condition usually employed at fluid wall interfaces breaks down. 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to quantify slip both in equilibrium and under shearing conditions.
Accurate descriptions of the highly nonlinear slip behavior is crucial, for instance to describe lubricated friction under extreme conditions.
The goal of this thesis is to test a recently proposed method that measures slip in equilibrium MD simulations .
Compared to previous studies, the viscosity of the confined fluid is not required as an input parameter but can be inferred from the spectral attenuation behavior of collective fluctuations.
Starting with simple interatomic potentials and planar slit geometries, the method shall be extended to cylincdrical nanopores such as carbon nanotubes filled with water.
