### Molecular simulation of wall slip

**Supervision: <a href="mailto:hannes.holey@kit.edu">Hannes Holey</a>, <a href="mailto:lars.pastewka@imtek.uni-freiburg.de">Lars Pastewka</a>**

When fluids are confined to only a few nanometers, the no-slip condition usually employed at fluid wall interfaces breaks down. 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to quantify slip both in equilibrium and under shearing conditions.
Accurate descriptions of the highly nonlinear slip behavior is crucial, for instance to describe lubricated friction under extreme conditions.
The goal of this thesis is to test a recently proposed method that measures slip in equilibrium MD simulations [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07501).
Compared to previous studies, the viscosity of the confined fluid is not required as an input parameter but can be inferred from the spectral attenuation behavior of collective fluctuations.
Starting with simple interatomic potentials and planar slit geometries, the method shall be extended to cylincdrical nanopores such as carbon nanotubes filled with water [[2]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aae0bd).
