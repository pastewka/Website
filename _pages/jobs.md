## How to apply

Please contact [Lars Pastewka](mailto:lars.pastewka@imtek.uni-freiburg.de) about these positions (and possibly other openings not posted here). We are a **simulation** group and do not conduct any experiments in the group. We are looking for candidates with the following profile:
* **Modeling:** You feel comfortable working with physical models, i.e. you understand how to describe the physical world around you in terms of differential equations.
* **Coding:** You have experience in writing codes that carry out numerical calculations or analyze data. Ideally, you have used Python, C++ or Rust.
* **Simulation:** You have written simulation codes or codes to evaluate simulation output yourself.

**Please do not apply if your only experience with simulations is running a simulation package, with the exception of molecular dynamics packages (e.g. LAMMPS or GROMACS).**

For applying, please send:
* **Letter of motivation**: Why do you apply for this position? Keep it short.
* **Curriculum vitae**: What is your experience?
* **Academic track record**: Grades from all BSc and MSc programs that you attended
* **References**: List of advisors that would be able to provide recommendation letters (PhD or Postdoc only)
