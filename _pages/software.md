## Atomistica

[Atomistica](https://github.com/Atomistica/atomistica) is a library of interatomic potentials for use with the [LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulator](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) and the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/), two widely used simulation environments for atomic-scale simulations such as molecular dynamics. Atomistica is developed in collaboration with the groups of [Michael Moseler](https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/tribologie/multiskalenmodellierung-tribosimulation.html) and [Gianpietro Moras](https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/tribologie/multiskalenmodellierung-tribosimulation.html) at Fraunhofer IWM.

## contact.engineering

[contact.engineering](https://contact.engineering/) is a web-service for the analysis of surface topography data and computation of relationships between load, displacement and contact area for rough surfaces using boundary element methods. The web application builds on a [larger ecosystem](https://github.com/ContactEngineering) for surface topography analysis and contact calculations developed by us. It is developed in collaboration with [Tevis Jacobs](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/JacobsLab/) at the University of Pittsburgh.

## matscipy

[matscipy](https://github.com/libAtoms/matscipy) is a library of utility functions for the atomistic treatment of elasticity, plasticity, fracture and other mechanical problems. It is based on the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/). matscipy is developed in collaboration with [James Kermode](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/people/james_kermode/) at Warwick University.

## muSpectre

[muSpectre](https://gitlab.com/muspectre/muspectre) is a spectral solver for homogeneization of continuum solid mechanical problems. The solver preconditioned the mechanical problem using FFTs, either in a strain- or a displacement-based formulation. We collaborate with [Jan Zeman](http://mech.fsv.cvut.cz/~zemanj/) of the Czech University in Prague on the development of FFT-accelerated solvers.

## USER-GFMD

USER-GFMD is a plugin for the widely used molecular dynamics code LAMMPS that implements Green's function molecular dynamics. USER-GFMD is based on a code by [Martin MÃ¼ser](https://www.lmp.uni-saarland.de/index.php/group/prof-dr-martin-muser/).
