  abstract      = "We investigate the behavior of amorphous silicon under
                   hydrostatic compression using molecular simulations. During
                   compression, amorphous silicon undergoes a discontinuous
                   nonequilibrium transition from a low-density to a
                   high-density structure at a pressure of around
                   $13$-$16$~GPa. Ensemble-averaged density and elastic
                   constants change discontinuously across the transition.
                   Densification of individual glassy samples occurs through a
                   series of discrete plastic events, each of which is
                   accompanied by a vanishing shear modulus. This is the
                   signature of a series of elastic instabilities, similar to
                   shear transformation zones observed during shear yielding of
                   glasses. We compare the structure obtained during
                   compression with a near-equilibrium form of amorphous
                   silicon obtained by quenching a melt at constant pressure.
                   This gives structures identical to nonequilibrium
                   compression at low and high pressure, but the transition
                   between them occurs gradually rather than discontinuously.
                   Our observations indicate that the polyamorphic transition
                   is of a nonequilibrium nature, and it has the
                   characteristics of a yield transition that occurs under
                   compression instead of shear.",

                   dependence. Here we combine mesoscopic simulations and
                   experiments to test the polymer-relaxation hypothesis for
                   this velocity dependence, where a velocity-dependent regime
                   emerges when the perturbation of interfacial polymer chains
                   occurs faster than their relaxation at high velocity. Our
                   simulations reproduce the experimental findings, with
                   speed-independent friction at low velocity, followed by a
                   friction coefficient that rises with velocity to some power
                   of order unity. We show that the velocity-dependent regime
                   is characterized by reorientation and stretching of polymer
                   chains in the direction of shear, leading to an entropic
                   stress that can be quantitatively related to the shear
                   response. The detailed exponent of the power law in the

                   observe a power close to $1/2$ for chains that can stretch,
                   while pure reorientation leads to a power of unity. Our

              analogously, a material's surface structure governs its surface
              properties---such as adhesion, friction, and surface stiffness.
              For bulk materials, microstructure is a critical component of
              structure; for surfaces, the structure is governed largely by
              surface topography. The articles in this issue cover the latest

               reproduce elastic properties, defect energies, bond breaking,
               bond formation, and even redox reactions. We discuss popular
               two-body potentials, embedded-atom models for metals, bond-order
               potentials for covalently bonded systems, polarizable potentials
               including charge-transfer approaches for ionic systems and
               quantum-Drude oscillator models mimicking higher-order and

               potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for elastic tensor
               elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of

  abstract = "Friction is one of the leading causes of energy loss in moving
              parts, and understanding how roughness affects friction is of
              utmost importance. From creating surfaces with high friction to
              prevent slip and movement, to creating surfaces with low friction
              to minimize energy loss, roughness plays a key role. By measuring
              shear stresses of crosslinked elastomers on three rough surfaces
              of similar surface chemistry across nearly six decades of sliding
              velocity, we demonstrate the dominant role of adhesive frictional
              dissipation. Furthermore, while it was previously known that
              roughness-induced oscillations affected the viscoelastic
              dissipation, we show that these oscillations also control the
              molecular detachment process and the resulting adhesive
              dissipation. This contrasts with typical models of friction,
              where only the amount of contact area and the strength of
              interfacial bonding govern the adhesive dissipation. Finally, we
              show that all the data can be collapsed onto a universal curve
              when the shear stress is scaled by the square root of elastic
              modulus and the velocity is scaled by a critical velocity at
              which the system exhibits macroscopic buckling instabilities.
              Taken together, these results suggest a design principle broadly

              account for this disconnect: (1) the challenge of integration of
              many different types of measurement for the same surface to
              capture the multi-scale nature of roughness; (2) the technical
              complexity of implementing spectral analysis methods, and of
              applying mechanical or numerical models to describe surface
              performance; (3) a lack of consistency between researchers and
              industries in how surfaces are measured, quantified, and
              communicated. Here we present a freely-available internet-based
              application which attempts to overcome all three challenges.
              First, the application enables the user to upload many different
              topography measurements taken from a single surface, including
              using different techniques, and then integrates all of them
              together to create a digital surface twin. Second, the
              application calculates many of the commonly used topography
              metrics, such as root-mean-square parameters, power spectral
              density (PSD), and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as
              implementing analytical and numerical calculations, such as
              boundary element modeling (BEM) for elastic and plastic
              deformation. Third, the application serves as a repository for
              users to securely store surfaces, and if they choose, to share
              these with collaborators or even publish them (with a digital
              object identifier) for all to access. The primary goal of this
              application is to enable researchers and manufacturers to quickly
              and easily apply cutting-edge tools for the characterization and
              properties-modeling of real-world surfaces. An additional goal is
              to advance the use of open-science principles in surface
              engineering by providing a FAIR database where researchers can
              choose to publish surface measurements for all to use.",

	abstract = {Modelling hydrodynamic lubrication is crucial in the design of engineering components as well as for a fundamental understanding of friction mechanisms. The cornerstone of thin-film flow modelling is the Reynolds equation -- a lower-dimensional representation of the Stokes equation. However, the derivation of the Reynolds equation is based on assumptions and fixed form constitutive relations, that may not generally be valid, especially when studying systems under extreme conditions. Furthermore, these explicit assumptions about the constitutive behaviour of the fluid prohibit applications in a multiscale scenario based on measured or atomistically simulated data. Here, we present a method that considers the full compressible Navier-Stokes equation in a height-averaged sense for arbitrary constitutive relations. We perform numerical tests by using a reformulation of the viscous stress tensor for laminar flow to validate the presented method comparing to results from conventional Reynolds solutions. The versatility of the method is shown by incorporating models for mass-conserving cavitation, wall slip and non-Newtonian fluids. This allows testing of new constitutive relations that not necessarily need to take a fixed form, and may be obtained from experimental or simulation data.},

Surface roughness reduces the area of contact between solids, with ramifications for phenomena that depend on the geometry of the interface and the amount of direct contact, including friction and adhesion. In this work, we employ large-scale boundary-element simulations for nonadhesive, elastic solids to study the size dependence of contact patch mean pressure and geometry for patches formed between solids with self-affine fractal surface roughness across seven decades in patch area. Contact patches with diameters smaller than a crossover length scale of order the minimum wavelength of roughness are generally compact with simple geometries and bear pressures well described by Hertz theory. The patch pressure in contact patches larger than the crossover scale rises logarithmically before saturating at a finite value. Furthermore, the largest contact patches formed during our simulations are ramified and populated with regions out of contact, or bubbles, which reduce patch area and increase patch perimeter. As a result, we show that the mean contact diameter of the largest patches saturates, indicating that the patch contact area is proportional to the total patch perimeter. We quantify the effects of bubbles on patch area and perimeters as a function of Hurst exponent and contrast our findings with results of comparable bearing-area model calculations. The slow evolution of the mean patch pressure with patch size in our large-scale calculations explains the common observation that the global mean contact pressure depends on the structure of the roughness, the contact area, and even on system size.},

Our work focuses on the adhesion of soft elastic spheres with low roughness or weak heterogeneity, where the indentation process can be described as a Griffith-like propagation of a nearly circular external crack. We discuss how to describe the contact of spheres with chemical heterogeneity that leads to fluctuations in the local work of adhesion. We introduce a variational first-order crack-perturbation model and validate our approach using boundary-element simulations. The crack-perturbation model faithfully predicts contact shapes and hysteretic force-penetration curves, provided that the contact perimeter remains close to a circle and the contact area is simply connected. Computationally, the crack-perturbation model is orders of magnitude more efficient than the corresponding boundary element formulation, allowing for realistic heterogeneity fields.},

We here generalize the compatibility projection introduced by Vondřejc et al. (2014) [24] beyond the Fourier basis. In particular, we formulate the compatibility projection for linear finite elements while maintaining Fourier-acceleration and the fast convergence properties of the original method. We demonstrate that this eliminates ringing artifacts and yields an efficient computational homogenization scheme that is equivalent to canonical finite-element formulations on fully structured grids.},

Here we take advantage of this scale-dependence to develop a new framework for characterizing rough surfaces: the Scale-Dependent Roughness Parameters (SDRP) analysis, which yields slope, curvature, and higher-order derivatives of surface topography at many scales, even for a single topography measurement. We demonstrate the relationship between SDRP and other common statistical methods for analyzing surfaces: the height-difference autocorrelation function (ACF), variable bandwidth methods (VBMs) and the power spectral density (PSD). We use computer-generated and measured topographies to demonstrate the benefits of SDRP analysis, including: novel metrics for characterizing surfaces across scales, and the detection of measurement artifacts. The SDRP is a generalized framework for scale-dependent analysis of surface topography that yields metrics that are intuitively understandable.},

	abstract = {In many microsystem applications, a nanometric surface quality is crucial to the performance of a device. Soft abrasive flow machining (SAFM) is capable of finishing surfaces at very fine scale with complex geometries since, unlike traditional flow machining processes, abrasive grains are carried by a very low viscosity fluid. Several empirical studies have been done to ensure final high quality surfaces by enhancing the performance of SAFM. However, the present study aims to propose a consistent numerical approach which can handle the fluid-structure interface problems as well as surface erosion to model SAFM and help to gain deeper understanding of the process. Moreover, the approach is employed to investigate the effect of an external magnetic field on the performance of the machining process. All phases, namely carrier fluid, abrasive grains and workpiece, and their interactions are fully resolved by using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The abrasive grains are modeled by particles that are rigidly moved together. The approach is used to study the surface finishing of a Polymethyl Methacrylate-based microchannel under external magnetic fields. Results show that a magnetic field of suitable strength can considerably improve the material removal rate and hence enhance the performance of SAFM.},

The characteristic length scale over which the power-law regime persists is given by the product of the rms surface slope and the mean diameter of contacting regions. We show that these results remain valid for weakly adhesive contacts and connect these observations to recent theories for adhesion between rough surfaces.},

Fully atomistic simulations must consider large blocks of atoms to support long-wavelength deformation modes, meaning that most atoms are far removed from the region of interest. Building on earlier methods that used elastic surface Green's functions to compute static substrate deformation, we present a numerically efficient dynamic Green's function technique to treat realistic, time-evolving, elastic solids. Our method solves substrate dynamics in reciprocal space and utilizes precomputed Green's functions that exactly reproduce elastic interactions without retaining the atomic degrees of freedom in the bulk. We invoke physical insights to determine the necessary number of explicit substrate layers required to capture the attenuation of subsurface waves as a function of surface wave vector. We observe that truncating substrate dynamics at depths that fall as a power of wave vector allows us to accurately model wave propagation without implementing arbitrary damping. The framework we have developed substantially accelerates molecular dynamics simulations of large elastic substrates. We apply the method to single asperity contact, impact, and sliding friction problems and present our preliminary findings.},

	abstract = {The surface topography of diamond coatings strongly affects surface properties such as adhesion, friction, wear, and biocompatibility. However, the understanding of multi-scale topography, and its effect on properties, has been hindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture only a single length scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are characterized using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness down to the sub-nanometer scale. Then these measurements are combined, using the power spectral density (PSD), with conventional methods (stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of topography. The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring topography across all length scales, especially because their PSDs cross over one another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger scale may be smoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements reveal the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with characteristic scaling behavior at and slightly below the mean grain size, and self-affine fractal-like roughness at other length scales. At small (subgrain) scales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness that is self-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This approach of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed comprehensive topography characterization, and all of the topography data from these surfaces has been made available for further analysis by experimentalists and theoreticians. Scientifically, this investigation has identified four characteristic regions of topography scaling in polycrystalline diamond materials.},

Here, we use atomic-scale simulations to make quantitative and mechanistic predictions of fracture of a-C. Systematic large-scale K-field controlled atomic-scale simulations of crack propagation are performed for a-C samples with densities of ρ=2.5, 3.0, and 3.5g/cm3 created by liquid quenches for a range of quench rates ˙Tq=10–1000K/ps. The simulations show that the crack propagates by nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids. Distances of ≈1nm between nucleated voids result in a brittlelike fracture toughness. We use a crack growth criterion proposed by Drugan, Rice, and Sham [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 30, 447 (1982)] to estimate steady-state fracture toughness based on our short crack-length fracture simulations. Fracture toughness values of 2.4–6.0MPa√m for initiation and 3–10MPa√m for the steady-state crack growth are within the experimentally reported range. These findings demonstrate that atomic-scale simulations can provide quantitatively predictive results even for fracture of materials with a ductile crack propagation mechanism.},

Among the existing numerical tools for topology optimization in engineering problems, the adjoint method represents a promising and versatile technique, which can also be applied to the field of full film tribology. In particular, the design of surfaces with complex textures can thoroughly benefit from this method, as it allows dealing with a large number of degrees of freedom at low computational cost. We show that this optimization method can be successfully applied to cavitating lubricant flows such as in pin-on-disc tribometers, giving the possibility to extend the results also to other typical applications such as journal and slider bearings. It is shown that the adjoint method can optimize the whole gap height distribution point by point in a more efficient way than traditional optimization approaches and parametric studies. In particular, thanks to the sensitivity analysis the adjoint method is able to find the placement and depth profile of each texture element.},

There is presently no unifying theory of the origin of roughness or the self-affine nature of surface topography. One likely contributor to the formation of roughness is deformation, which underlies many processes that shape surfaces such as machining, fracture, and wear. Using molecular dynamics, we simulate the biaxial compression of single-crystal Au, the high-entropy alloy Ni36.67Co30Fe16.67Ti16.67, and amorphous Cu50Zr50 and show that even surfaces of homogeneous materials develop a self-affine structure. By characterizing subsurface deformation, we connect the self-affinity of the surface to the spatial correlation of deformation events occurring within the bulk and present scaling relations for the evolution of roughness with strain. These results open routes toward interpreting and engineering roughness profiles.

	abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of adhesion in soft materials is critical in the fields of transportation (tires, gaskets, and seals), biomaterials, microcontact printing, and soft robotics. Measurements have long demonstrated that the apparent work of adhesion coming into contact is consistently lower than the intrinsic work of adhesion for the materials, and that there is adhesion hysteresis during separation, commonly explained by viscoelastic dissipation. Still lacking is a quantitative experimentally validated link between adhesion and measured topography. Here, we used in situ measurements of contact size to investigate the adhesion behavior of soft elastic polydimethylsiloxane hemispheres (modulus ranging from 0.7 to 10 MPa) on 4 different polycrystalline diamond substrates with topography characterized across 8 orders of magnitude, including down to the angstrom scale. The results show that the reduction in apparent work of adhesion is equal to the energy required to achieve conformal contact. Further, the energy loss during contact and removal is equal to the product of the intrinsic work of adhesion and the true contact area. These findings provide a simple mechanism to quantitatively link the widely observed adhesion hysteresis to roughness rather than viscoelastic dissipation.},

@article{li_glass_2019,
	Abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the formation of glasses
during severe plastic deformation of crystalline Cu{\textbar}Zr nano-layers in a
simple shear geometry. The early stage of plasticity is governed by
dislocation plasticity. Dislocation-interface interaction induces
interface roughening and slow atomic-level intermixing around interfaces.
A solid-state crystal-to-amorphous transition starts near the interfaces.
At high strain, the interfaces are refined to merge, leading to the
formation of an intermixed glassy zone that eventually spans our
simulation cell. Dislocation emission is then suppressed and strain is
fully accommodated by this glassy phase. We characterize the
crystal-to-amorphous transition using local structural measures, such as
the pair distribution function and Voronoi analysis. The onset of glass
formation occurs at a critical shear strain that increases with layer
thickness. Our simulations indicate that the parameter controlling this
onset is the theoretical affine interface distance, i.e. the amorphization
occurs at a critical value of around 3--4 nm that increases slightly with
the increase of layer thickness. Our work provides insights on
mechanically driven glass formation in multicomponent systems, as e.g.
realized in ball-mills or high-pressure torsion experiments.},

condensation followed by in situ compaction. Elemental segregation of Ni

nearly pure Nickel (96\%) nanophases form within the amorphous Ni50Ti50
alloy. Combining atom probe tomography and scanning transmission electron
microscopy with computer modelling, we explore the formation process of
such amorphous nanophase structure. It is shown that the Ni rich amorphous
phase in the consolidated nanostructured material is responsible for the
ferromagnetic behavior of the sample whereas the rapidly quenched
amorphous and crystalline samples with the same chemical composition
(Ni50Ti50) were found to be paramagnetic. Due to the high cooling rate
obtained using the inert gas condensation technique, an exceptional
control over the crystallization processes is possible, promoting the
formation of various amorphous phases, which are not obtained by standard
rapid quenching techniques. Our findings demonstrate the potential of
amorphous metallic nanostructures as advanced technological materials, and
useful magnetic compounds.},

@article{khanal_characterization_2018,
	Abstract = {Multi-scale surface topography is critical to surface function, yet the
very smallest scales of topography are not accessible with conventional
measurement techniques. Here we demonstrate two separate approaches for
measuring small-scale topography in a transmission electron microscope
(TEM). The first technique harnesses `conventional' methods for
preparation of a TEM cross-section, and presents how these methods may be
modified to ensure the preservation of the original surface. The second
technique involves the deposition of the material of interest on a
pre-fabricated substrate. Both techniques enable the observation and
quantification of surface topography with {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale resolution. Then,
using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to quantify the sample
thickness, we demonstrate that there is no systematic effect of thickness
on the statistical measurements of roughness. This result was verified
using mathematical simulations of artificial surfaces with varying
thickness. The proposed explanation is that increasing the side-view
thickness of a randomly rough surface may change which specific features
are sampled, but does not significantly alter the character (e.g.
root-mean-square (RMS) values and power spectral density (PSD)) of the
measured topography. Taken together, this work establishes a new approach
to topography characterization, which fills in a critical gap in
conventional approaches: i.e. the measurement of smallest-scale
topography.},

Our work opens up new perspectives for modeling the surfaces and

	Abstract = {This paper summarizes the submissions to a recently announced
contact-mechanics modeling challenge. The task was to solve a typical,
albeit mathematically fully defined problem on the adhesion between
nominally flat surfaces. The surface topography of the rough, rigid
substrate, the elastic properties of the indenter, as well as the
short-range adhesion between indenter and substrate, were specified so
that diverse quantities of interest, e.g., the distribution of interfacial
stresses at a given load or the mean gap as a function of load, could be
computed and compared to a reference solution. Many different solution
strategies were pursued, ranging from traditional asperity-based models
via Persson theory and brute-force computational approaches, to
real-laboratory experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of
a model, in which the original assignment was scaled down to the atomistic
scale. While each submission contained satisfying answers for at least a
subset of the posed questions, efficiency, versatility, and accuracy
differed between methods, the more precise methods being, in general,
computationally more complex. The aim of this paper is to provide both
theorists and experimentalists with benchmarks to decide which method is
the most appropriate for a particular application and to gauge the errors
associated with each one.},

@article{riegger_read-out_2006,
	Abstract = {We present novel concepts to process and read out multiplexed, bead-based
fluorescence immunoassays. At the start of the read-out process, a
statistically arranged monolayer of color-encoded beads is aggregated in a
detection chamber. Each bead is first identified by incorporated color
tags which are either dyes or luminescing quantum dots (QDs).
Subsequently, the reaction-specific fluorescence signal is quantified. The
read-out process is accelerated by an in-house-developed image-processing
algorithm. The optical read-out device consists of standard components,
e.g. a color CCD-camera as detection unit, an LED as light source, optical
filters, and a drive to spin the polymer disk. The liquid handling along
the complete assay protocol is realized on a centrifugal lab-on-a-disk
platform. We successfully demonstrate the performance of this device by
the implementation of a hepatitis A and a tetanus assay. (C) 2005 Elsevier

discretization scheme to Phillips' model for shear-induced particle
migration in concentrated suspensions. This model provides an evolution
equation for the scalar mean volume fraction of idealized spherical solid
particles of equal diameter which is discretized by the SPH formalism. In
order to obtain a discrete evolution equation with exact conservation
properties we treat in fact the occupied volume of the solid particles as
the degree of freedom for the fluid particles. We present simulation
results in two- and three-dimensional channel flow. The two-dimensional
results serve as a verification by a comparison to analytic solutions. The
three-dimensional results are used for a comparison with experimental
measurements obtained from computer tomography of injection moulded
ceramic microparts. We observe the best agreement of measurements with
snapshots of the transient simulation for a ratio D(c)/D(η)=0.1 of the two
model parameters.},

@article{pastewka_molecular_2010,
	Abstract = {The lubrication mechanisms in ultrathin solid gold films confined between
two rough nickel surfaces have been investigated employing classical
molecular dynamics with a second moment tight-binding potential. Three
types of nickel surfaces are considered: Ni(111), Ni(001) single- and an
Ni(001) - (111) bicrystal. In all three systems, gold layers that have
been quenched from the melt organise in (111) layers parallel to the
nickel interfaces. The relative sliding of the two single crystal nickel
tribopartners requires a shear stress of around 170 MPa - a value that is
almost one order of magnitude lower than the ideal plastic shear stress of
single crystal bulk gold. This reduced stress can be explained by a misfit
dislocation mechanism in a single plane close to the Ni/Au interface. In
the case of the Ni(001) - (111) bicrystal, the nickel grain boundaries
induce grain boundaries in the quenched gold film which vanish during
sliding. During subsequent sliding the nickel grain boundaries act as
nucleation centres for dislocation loops leading to an increased shear
stress of 490 MPa. The same is observed for an embedded hydrocarbon
impurity. Also here dislocation loops are emitted on (111) planes that are
tilted with respect to the sliding plane.},

@article{pastewka_contact_2014,
	Abstract = {At the molecular scale, there are strong attractive interactions between
surfaces, yet few macroscopic surfaces are sticky. Extensive simulations
of contact by adhesive surfaces with roughness on nanometer to micrometer
scales are used to determine how roughness reduces the area where atoms
contact and thus weakens adhesion. The material properties, adhesive
strength, and roughness parameters are varied by orders of magnitude. In
all cases, the area of atomic contact is initially proportional to the
load. The prefactor rises linearly with adhesive strength for weak
attractions. Above a threshold adhesive strength, the prefactor changes
sign, the surfaces become sticky, and a finite force is required to
separate them. A parameter-free analytic theory is presented that
describes changes in these numerical results over up to five orders of
magnitude in load. It relates the threshold adhesive strength to roughness
and material properties, explaining why most macroscopic surfaces do not
stick. The numerical results are qualitatively and quantitatively
inconsistent with classical theories based on the Greenwood-Williamson
approach that neglect the range of adhesion and do not include asperity
interactions.},

@article{gujrati_combining_2018,
	Abstract = {Surface roughness affects the functional properties of surfaces, including
adhesion, friction, hydrophobicity, biological response, and electrical
and thermal transport properties. However, experimental investigations to
quantify these links are often inconclusive, because surfaces are
fractal-like and the values of measured roughness parameters depend on
measurement size. Here we demonstrate the characterization of topography
of an ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) surface at the {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as its combination
with conventional techniques to achieve a comprehensive surface
description spanning eight orders of magnitude in size. We performed more
than 100 individual measurements of the nanodiamond film using both TEM
and conventional techniques (stylus profilometry and atomic force
microscopy). While individual measurements of root-mean-square (RMS)
height, RMS slope, and RMS curvature vary by orders of magnitude, we
combine the various techniques using the power spectral density (PSD) and
use this to compute scale-independent parameters. This analysis reveals
that "smooth" UNCD surfaces have an RMS slope greater than one, even
larger than the slope of the Austrian Alps when measured on the scale of a
human step. This approach of comprehensive multi-scale roughness
characterization, measured with {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m-scale detail, will enable the
systematic evaluation and optimization of other technologically relevant
surfaces, as well as systematic testing of the many analytical and
numerical models for the behavior of rough surfaces.},

discontinuity parallel to the surface separating the near-surface layer
from the bulk. Despite its ubiquitous observation, the origin of this
layer underneath the surface remains elusive. Here, we show that already
after the first loading pass a localized dislocation structure is found at
a depth of 100--150 nm. This structure is linked to the inhomogeneous
stress field under the moving indenter, where dislocations are trapped
when the stress drops below the material's yield stress. Control of the
initial tribological loading could therefore be exploited to design
surfaces and materials with superior tribological properties.},

@article{weber_molecular_2018,
	Abstract = {Amontons' law defines the friction coefficient as the ratio between
friction force and normal force, and assumes that both these forces depend
linearly on the real contact area between the two sliding surfaces.
However, experimental testing of frictional contact models has proven
difficult, because few in situ experiments are able to resolve this real
contact area. Here, we present a contact detection method with
molecular-level sensitivity. We find that while the friction force is
proportional to the real contact area, the real contact area does not
increase linearly with normal force. Contact simulations show that this is
due to both elastic interactions between asperities on the surface and
contact plasticity of the asperities. We reproduce the contact area and
fine details of the measured contact geometry by including plastic
hardening into the simulations. These new insights will pave the way for a
quantitative microscopic understanding of contact mechanics and tribology.},

	Abstract = {We use a combination of atom-swap Monte-Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics
(MD) to study the structure and mechanical properties of Cu1−xAgx{\textbar}Ni
multilayers with 6 nm layer width for which the Ag-content is used to tune
the lattice misfit. We find that the multilayers form a semi-coherent
interface with a network of partial dislocations arranged in a regular
triangular pattern. A combination of MC and MD was used to equilibrate
Cu1−xAgx{\textbar}Ni with x = 0\%, 5\% and 10\%. Ag does not enter the Ni-layer but
segregates and precipitates from the Cu layers. We find alloying of Cu and
Ni at 600 K. All these findings are in good agreement with the
experimental binary phase diagrams of the Cu-Ag, Ag-Ni and Cu-Ni systems.
The resulting multilayer structures were then sheared parallel and
perpendicular to the normal of the bilayer interface. Initial sliding
takes place at the Cu{\textbar}Ni interface within the misfit dislocation network,
followed by emission of partial dislocations into the Cu layer. Flow
stress increases with increasing Ag content. Additional calculations of
biaxial tension that suppress sliding at the heterointerface show a
similar trend. Strengthening can be attributed to Ag precipitates pinning
the Cu{\textbar}Ni heterointerface and to the formation of sessile stacking-fault
tetrahedra from the misfit dislocation network whose density increases
with the concentration of Ag in the Cu layer.},

@article{jacobs_quantitative_2017,
	Abstract = {Roughness determines many functional properties of surfaces, such as
adhesion, friction, and (thermal and electrical) contact conductance.
Recent analytical models and simulations enable quantitative prediction of
these properties from knowledge of the power spectral density (PSD) of the
surface topography. The utility of the PSD is that it contains statistical
information that is unbiased by the particular scan size and pixel
resolution chosen by the researcher. In this article, we first review the
mathematical definition of the PSD, including the one- and two-dimensional
cases, and common variations of each. We then discuss strategies for
reconstructing an accurate PSD of a surface using topography measurements
at different size scales. Finally, we discuss detection and mitigating
artifacts at the smallest scales, and how to compute upper/lower bounds on
functional properties obtained from models. We accompany our discussion
with virtual measurements on computer-generated surfaces. This discussion
summarizes how to analyze topography measurements to reconstruct a
reliable PSD. Analytical models demonstrate the potential for tuning
functional properties by rationally tailoring surface topography -
however, this potential can only be achieved through the accurate,
quantitative reconstruction of the power spectral density of real-world
surfaces.},

the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and
analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in
Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array
library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For
example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a
simple 'for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses
and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external
electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On
top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many
standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular
dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band
calculations.},

@article{romero_surface_2014,
	Abstract = {Tetrahedral amorphous carbon coatings have the potential to significantly reduce friction and wear between sliding components. Here, we provide atomistic insights into the evolution of the sliding interface between naked and hydrogen-passivated ta-C sliding partners under dry and lubricated conditions. Using reactive classical atomistic simulations we show that sliding induces a sp3 to sp2 rehybridization and that the shear resistance is reduced by hydrogen-passivation and hexadecane-lubrication---despite our finding that nanoscale hexadecane layers are not always able to separate and protect ta-C counter surfaces during sliding. As asperities deform, carbon atoms within the hexadecane lubricant bind to the ta-C sliding partners resulting in degradation of the hexadecane molecules and in increased material intermixing at the sliding interface. Hydrogen atoms from the passivation layer and from the hexadecane chains continue to be mixed within a sp2 rich sliding interface eventually generating a tribo-layer that resembles an a-C:H type of material. Upon separation of the sliding partners, the tribo-couple splits within the newly formed sp2 rich a-C:H mixed layer with significant material transfer across the sliding partners. This leaves behind a-C:H coated ta-C surfaces with dangling C bonds, linear C chains and hydrocarbon fragments.},

	abstract = {Numerous rock engineering applications require a reliable estimation of
fracture permeabilities to predict fluid flow and transport processes.
Since measurements of fracture properties at great depth are extremely
elaborate, representative fracture geometries typically are obtained from
outcrops or core drillings. Thus, physically valid numerical approaches
are required to compute the actual fracture geometries under in situ
stress conditions. Hence, the objective of this study is the validation of
a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based numerical approach for a circular
granodiorite fracture considering stress-dependent normal closure. The
numerical approach employs both purely elastic and elastic–plastic contact
deformation models, which are based on high-resolution fracture scans and
representative mechanical properties, which were measured in laboratory
experiments. The numerical approaches are validated by comparing the
simulated results with uniaxial laboratory tests. The normal stresses
applied in the axial direction of the cylindrical specimen vary between
0.25 and 10 MPa. The simulations indicate the best performance for the
elastic–plastic model, which fits well with experimentally derived normal
closure data (root-mean-squared error = 9 µm). The validity of the
elastic–plastic model is emphasized by a more realistic reproduction of
aperture distributions, local stresses and contact areas along the
fracture. Although there are differences in simulated closure for the
elastic and elastic–plastic models, only slight differences in the
resulting aperture distributions are observed. In contrast to alternative
interpenetration models or analytical models such as the Barton–Bandis
models and the “exponential repulsion model”, the numerical simulations
reproduce heterogeneous local closure as well as low-contact areas ({\textless} 2\%)
even at high normal stresses (10 MPa), which coincides with findings of
former experimental studies. Additionally, a relative hardness value of
0.14 for granitic rocks, which defines the general resistance to
non-elastic deformation of the contacts, is introduced and successfully
applied for the elastic–plastic model.},
